We and others have previously shown a relationship between the human gut microbiota and colorectal cancer; however, its relationship to the different early precursors of colorectal cancer is understudied. We tested, for the first time, the relationship of the gut microbiota to specific colorectal polyp types. RESULTS: Gut microbiota were assessed in 540 colonoscopy-screened adults by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of stool samples. Participants were categorized as CA cases (n = 144), serrated polyp cases (n = 73), or polyp-free controls (n = 323). CA cases were further classified as proximal (n = 87) or distal (n = 55) and as non-advanced (n = 121) or advanced (n = 22). Serrated polyp cases were further classified as hyperplastic polyp (HP; n = 40) or sessile serrated adenoma (SSA; n = 33). We compared gut microbiota diversity, overall composition, and normalized taxon abundance among these groups. CA cases had lower species richness in stool than controls (p = 0.03); in particular, this association was strongest for advanced CA cases (p = 0.004). In relation to overall microbiota composition, only distal or advanced CA cases differed significantly from controls (p = 0.02 and p = 0.002). In taxon-based analysis, stool of CA cases was depleted in a network of Clostridia operational taxonomic units from families Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Lachnospiraceae, and enriched in the classes Bacilli and Gammaproteobacteria, order Enterobacteriales, and genera Actinomyces and Streptococcus (all q < 0.10). SSA and HP cases did not differ in diversity or composition from controls, though sample size for these groups was small. Few taxa were differentially abundant between HP cases or SSA cases and controls; among them, class Erysipelotrichi was depleted in SSA cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that gut microbes may play a role in the early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis through the development of CAs. Findings may have implications for developing colorectal cancer prevention therapies targeting early microbial drivers of colorectal carcinogenesis.",Complete,"Shaimaa Elsafoury"

Prior investigations have been limited to comparisons of microbiota obtained from surface swabs of the oral cavity. This study aims to identify microbiomic differences in paired tumor and non-tumor tissue samples in a large group of 121 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and correlate these differences with clinical-pathologic features. METHODS: Total DNA was extracted from paired normal and tumor resection specimens from 169 patients; 242 samples from 121 patients were included in the final analysis. Microbiomic content of each sample was determined using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis was performed using QIIME algorithms. F-testing on cluster strength, Wilcoxon signed-rank testing on differential relative abundances of paired tumor-normal samples, and Wilcoxon rank-sum testing on the association of T-stage with relative abundances were conducted in R. RESULTS: We observed no significant difference in measures of alpha diversity between tumor and normal tissue (Shannon index: p = 0.13, phylogenetic diversity: p = 0.42). Similarly, although we observed statistically significantly differences in both weighted (p = 0.01) and unweighted (p = 0.04) Unifrac distances between tissue types, the tumor/normal grouping explained only a small proportion of the overall variation in the samples (weighted R2 = 0.01, unweighted R2 < 0.01). Notably, however, when comparing the relative abundances of individual taxa between matched pairs of tumor and normal tissue, we observed that Actinomyces and its parent taxa up to the phylum level were significantly depleted in tumor relative to normal tissue (q < 0.01), while Parvimonas was increased in tumor relative to normal tissue (q = 0.01). These differences were more pronounced among patients with more extensive disease as measured by higher T-stage. CONCLUSIONS: Matched pairs analysis of individual tumor-normal pairs revealed significant differences in relative abundance of specific taxa, namely in the genus Actinomyces. These differences were more pronounced among patients with higher T-stage. Our observations suggest further experiments to interrogate potential novel mechanisms relevant to carcinogenesis associated with alterations of the oral microbiome that may have consequences for the human host.",Complete,"Shaimaa Elsafoury"

METHODS: Microbiota and metabolomics profiling were performed on lyophilized feces from 42 CRC cases and 89 matched controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify statistically independent associations with CRC. First principal coordinate-component pair (PCo1-PC1) and false discovery rate (0.05)-corrected P-values were calculated for 116,000 Pearson correlations between 530 metabolites and 220 microbes in a sex*case/control meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall microbe-metabolite PCo1-PC1 was more strongly correlated in cases than in controls (Rho 0.606 vs 0.201, P = 0.01). CRC was independently associated with lower levels of Clostridia, Lachnospiraceae, p-aminobenzoate and conjugated linoleate, and with higher levels of Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, p-hydroxy-benzaldehyde, and palmitoyl-sphingomyelin. Through postulated effects on cell shedding (palmitoyl-sphingomyelin), inflammation (conjugated linoleate), and innate immunity (p-aminobenzoate), metabolites mediated the CRC association with Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas by 29% and 34%, respectively. Overall, palmitoyl-sphingomyelin correlated directly with abundances of Enterobacteriaceae (Gammaproteobacteria), three Actinobacteria and five Firmicutes. Only Parabacteroides correlated inversely with palmitoyl-sphingomyelin. Other lipids correlated inversely with Alcaligenaceae (Betaproteobacteria). Six Bonferroni-significant correlations were found, including low indolepropionate and threnoylvaline with Actinobacteria and high erythronate and an uncharacterized metabolite with Enterobacteriaceae. CONCLUSIONS: Feces from CRC cases had very strong microbe-metabolite correlations that were predominated by Enterobacteriaceae and Actinobacteria. Metabolites mediated a direct CRC association with Fusobacterium and Porphyromonas, but not an inverse association with Clostridia and Lachnospiraceae.

While HCV epidemiology, pathophysiology, and therapy are being deeply studied, rare attention is given to reciprocal interactions between HCV infection , HCV-induced chronic liver diseases, and the human gut microbiome. As Egypt has the world's highest prevalence of HCV infections, we launched this study to monitor differences in the gut microbial community composition of Egyptian HCV patients that may affect, or result from, the patients' liver state. RESULTS: To this end, we analyzed stool samples from six stage 4-HCV patients and eight healthy individuals by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing using Illumina MiSeq. Overall, the alpha-diversity of the healthy persons' gut microbiomes was higher than those of the HCV patients. Whereas members of phylum Bacteroidetes were more abundant in HCV patients, healthy individuals had higher abundance of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Genus-level analysis showed differential abundance of Prevotella and Faecalibacterium (higher in HCV patients) vs. Ruminococcus and Clostridium (healthy group), indicating that the higher abundance of Bacteroidetes in HCV patients is most likely due to Prevotella overabundance. The probiotic genus, Bifidobacterium, was only observed in the microbiotas of healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this study provides a first overview of major phyla and genera differentiating stage 4-HCV patients from healthy individuals and suggests possible microbiome remodeling in chronic hepatitis C, possibly shaped by bacterial translocation as well as the liver's impaired role in digestion and protein synthesis. Future studies will investigate the microbiome composition and functional capabilities in more patients while tracing some potential biomarker taxa (e.g., Prevotella, Faecalibacterium vs. Bifidobacterium).",Complete,"Shaimaa Elsafoury"

Even during periods of stable lung function, the lung harbors a community of bacteria, termed the microbiome. The role of the lung microbiome in the pathogenesis of COPD remains unknown. The COPD lung microbiome, like the healthy lung microbiome, appears to reflect microaspiration of oral microflora. Here we describe the COPD lung microbiome of 22 patients with Moderate or Severe COPD compared to 10 healthy control patients. The composition of the lung microbiomes was determined using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Sequences were analyzed using mothur, Ribosomal Database Project, Fast UniFrac, and Metastats. Our results showed a significant increase in microbial diversity with the development of COPD. The main phyla in all samples were Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Principal coordinate analyses demonstrated separation of control and COPD samples, but samples did not cluster based on disease severity. However, samples did cluster based on the use of inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled bronchodilators.

In the present study, we have examined the fecal microbial flora of 33 subjects with various severities of autism with gastrointestinal symptoms, 7 siblings not showing autistic symptoms (sibling controls) and eight non-sibling control subjects, using the bacterial tag encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) procedure. The results provide us with information on the microflora of stools of young children and a compelling picture of unique fecal microflora of children with autism with gastrointestinal symptomatology. Differences based upon maximum observed and maximum predicted operational taxonomic units were statistically significant when comparing autistic and control subjects with p-values ranging from <0.001 to 0.009 using both parametric and non-parametric estimators. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes showed the most difference between groups of varying severities of autism. Bacteroidetes was found at high levels in the severely autistic group, while Firmicutes were more predominant in the control group. Smaller, but significant, differences also occurred in the Actinobacterium and Proteobacterium phyla. Desulfovibrio species and Bacteroides vulgatus are present in significantly higher numbers in stools of severely autistic children than in controls.

The aim of this study was to assess the differences between the composition of the intestinal microbiota in humans with type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic persons as control. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The study included 36 male adults with a broad range of age and body-mass indices (BMIs), among which 18 subjects were diagnosed with diabetes type 2. The fecal bacterial composition was investigated by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and in a subgroup of subjects (N = 20) by tag-encoded amplicon pyrosequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The proportions of phylum Firmicutes and class Clostridia were significantly reduced in the diabetic group compared to the control group (P = 0.03). Furthermore, the ratios of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes as well as the ratios of Bacteroides-Prevotella group to C. coccoides-E. rectale group correlated positively and significantly with plasma glucose concentration (P = 0.04) but not with BMIs. Similarly, class Betaproteobacteria was highly enriched in diabetic compared to non-diabetic persons (P = 0.02) and positively correlated with plasma glucose (P = 0.04).

Our objective was to characterize the microbiota and associate the microbiota with the tumor expression profiles, for 668 breast tumor tissues and 72 non-cancerous adjacent tissues. The prominent presence of Proteobacteria was increased in the tumor tissues and conversely Actinobacteria abundance increase in non-cancerous adjacent tissues. Further, geneset enrichment suggests Listeria spp to be associated with the expression profiles of genes involved with epithelial to mesenchymal transitions. Moreover, evidence suggests H. influenza may reside in the surrounding stromal material and was significantly associated with the proliferative pathways: G2M checkpoint, E2F transcription factors, and mitotic spindle assembly.

Recent evidence demonstrates that gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to obesity and its comorbidities. The body weight-reducing and energy balancing effects of melatonin have been reported in several studies, but to date, no investigations toward examining whether the beneficial effects of melatonin are associated with gut microbiota have been carried out. In this study, we show that melatonin reduces body weight, liver steatosis, and low-grade inflammation as well as improving insulin resistance in high fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. High-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA demonstrated that melatonin treatment significantly changed the composition of the gut microbiota in mice fed an HFD. The richness and diversity of gut microbiota were notably decreased by melatonin. HFD feeding altered 69 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) compare with a normal chow diet (NCD) group, and melatonin supplementation reversed 14 OTUs to the same configuration than those present in the NCD group, thereby impacting various functions, in particular through its ability to decrease the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio and increase the abundance of mucin-degrading bacteria Akkermansia, which is associated with healthy mucosa.

To dissociate changes in the gut microbiota associated with high HF feeding from those associated with obesity, we took advantage of the different susceptibility of C57BL/6JBomTac (BL6) and 129S6/SvEvTac (Sv129) mice to diet-induced obesity and of their different responses to inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, where inhibition of COX activity in BL6 mice prevents HF diet-induced obesity, but in Sv129 mice accentuates obesity. RESULTS: Using HiSeq-based whole genome sequencing, we identified taxonomic and functional differences in the gut microbiota of the two mouse strains fed regular low-fat or HF diets with or without supplementation with the COX-inhibitor, indomethacin. HF feeding rather than obesity development led to distinct changes in the gut microbiota. We observed a robust increase in alpha diversity, gene count, abundance of genera known to be butyrate producers, and abundance of genes involved in butyrate production in Sv129 mice compared to BL6 mice fed either a LF or a HF diet. Conversely, the abundance of genes involved in propionate metabolism, associated with increased energy harvest, was higher in BL6 mice than Sv129 mice. CONCLUSIONS: The changes in the composition of the gut microbiota were predominantly driven by high-fat feeding rather than reflecting the obese state of the mice. Differences in the abundance of butyrate and propionate producing bacteria in the gut may at least in part contribute to the observed differences in obesity propensity in Sv129 and BL6 mice.",Complete,"Shaimaa Elsafoury"

However, data about gut dysbiosis in human NAFLD remain scarce in the literature, especially studies including the whole spectrum of NAFLD lesions. We aimed to evaluate the association between gut dysbiosis and severe NAFLD lesions, that is, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis, in a well-characterized population of adult NAFLD. Fifty-seven patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD were enrolled. Taxonomic composition of gut microbiota was determined using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of stool samples. Thirty patients had F0/F1 fibrosis stage at liver biopsy (10 with NASH), and 27 patients had significant F≥2 fibrosis (25 with NASH). Bacteroides abundance was significantly increased in NASH and F≥2 patients, whereas Prevotella abundance was decreased. Ruminococcus abundance was significantly higher in F≥2 patients. By multivariate analysis, Bacteroides abundance was independently associated with NASH and Ruminococcus with F≥2 fibrosis. Stratification according to the abundance of these two bacteria generated three patient subgroups with increasing severity of NAFLD lesions. Based on imputed metagenomic profiles, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways significantly related to NASH and fibrosis F≥2 were mostly related to carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. CONCLUSION: NAFLD severity associates with gut dysbiosis and a shift in metabolic function of the gut microbiota. We identified Bacteroides as independently associated with NASH and Ruminococcus with significant fibrosis.

RESULTS: In this study, we characterized the 16S gut community of a subset of 63 subjects from this unique cohort. We found that these communities, when compared to Human Microbiome Project subjects, exhibit community shifts often observed in obese and T2D individuals in published studies. We also examined microbial network relationships between operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC) and three additional datasets. We identified a group of seven genera that form a tightly interconnected network present in all four tested datasets, dominated by butyrate producers, which are often increased in obese individuals while being depleted in T2D patients. CONCLUSIONS: Through a combination of increased disease prevalence and relatively high gut microbial homogeneity in the subset of CCHC members we examined, we believe that the CCHC may represent an ideal community to dissect mechanisms underlying the role of the gut microbiome in human health and disease. The lack of CCHC subject gut community segregation based on all tested metadata suggests that the community structure we observe in the CCHC likely occurs early in life, and endures.

Here we analyzed the microbiota of the surface layer and the deeper layers of the stratum corneum of normal skin, and we investigated the dynamics of recolonization of skin microbiota following skin barrier disruption by tape stripping as a model of superficial injury. RESULTS: We observed gender differences in microbiota composition and showed that bacteria are not uniformly distributed in the stratum corneum. Phylogenetic distance analysis was employed to follow microbiota development during recolonization of injured skin. Surprisingly, the developing neo-microbiome at day 14 was more similar to that of the deeper stratum corneum layers than to the initial surface microbiome. In addition, we also observed variation in the host response towards superficial injury as assessed by the induction of antimicrobial protein expression in epidermal keratinocytes. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the microbiome of the deeper layers, rather than that of the superficial skin layer, may be regarded as the host indigenous microbiome.

Differences in the bacterial community structure were analyzed by 16S sequencing in 39 men and 36 post-menopausal women, who had similar dietary background, matched by age and stratified according to the BMI. We observed that the abundance of the Bacteroides genus was lower in men than in women (P<0.001, Q = 0.002) when BMI was > 33. In fact, the abundance of this genus decreased in men with an increase in BMI (P<0.001, Q<0.001). However, in women, it remained unchanged within the different ranges of BMI. We observed a higher presence of Veillonella (84.6% vs. 47.2%; X2 test P = 0.001, Q = 0.019) and Methanobrevibacter genera (84.6% vs. 47.2%; X2 test P = 0.002, Q = 0.026) in fecal samples in men compared to women.

RESULTS: Here, using a unique transgenic model, we report that maternal endogenous n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) production during gestation or lactation significantly reduces weight gain and markers of metabolic disruption in male murine offspring fed a high-fat diet. However, maternal fatty acid status appeared to have no significant effect on weight gain in female offspring. The metabolic phenotypes in male offspring appeared to be mediated by comprehensive restructuring of gut microbiota composition. Reduced maternal n-3 PUFA exposure led to significantly depleted Epsilonproteobacteria, Bacteroides, and Akkermansia and higher relative abundance of Clostridia. Interestingly, offspring metabolism and microbiota composition were more profoundly influenced by the maternal fatty acid profile during lactation than in utero. Furthermore, the maternal fatty acid profile appeared to have a long-lasting effect on offspring microbiota composition and function that persisted into adulthood after life-long high-fat diet feeding.

We pursued rigorous clinical characterization, fecal bacterial metagenomics, and plasma immune molecule analyses in 50 ME/CFS patients and 50 healthy controls frequency-matched for age, sex, race/ethnicity, geographic site, and season of sampling. RESULTS: Topological analysis revealed associations between IBS co-morbidity, body mass index, fecal bacterial composition, and bacterial metabolic pathways but not plasma immune molecules. IBS co-morbidity was the strongest driving factor in the separation of topological networks based on bacterial profiles and metabolic pathways. Predictive selection models based on bacterial profiles supported findings from topological analyses indicating that ME/CFS subgroups, defined by IBS status, could be distinguished from control subjects with high predictive accuracy. Bacterial taxa predictive of ME/CFS patients with IBS were distinct from taxa associated with ME/CFS patients without IBS. Increased abundance of unclassified Alistipes and decreased Faecalibacterium emerged as the top biomarkers of ME/CFS with IBS; while increased unclassified Bacteroides abundance and decreased Bacteroides vulgatus were the top biomarkers of ME/CFS without IBS. Despite findings of differences in bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways defining ME/CFS subgroups, decreased metabolic pathways associated with unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis and increased atrazine degradation pathways were independent of IBS co-morbidity. Increased vitamin B6 biosynthesis/salvage and pyrimidine ribonucleoside degradation were the top metabolic pathways in ME/CFS without IBS as well as in the total ME/CFS cohort. In ME/CFS subgroups, symptom severity measures including pain, fatigue, and reduced motivation were correlated with the abundance of distinct bacterial taxa and metabolic pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of IBS, ME/CFS is associated with dysbiosis and distinct bacterial metabolic disturbances that may influence disease severity. However, our findings indicate that dysbiotic features that are uniquely ME/CFS-associated may be masked by disturbances arising from the high prevalence of IBS co-morbidity in ME/CFS.

Microbial community analysis and correlation to clinical parameters was performed with QIIME, differential abundance analysis of taxa encompassed linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe). RESULTS: We found a negative correlation between microbial alpha-diversity and illness duration in BD (R = -0.408, P = 0.021). Furthermore, we identified bacterial clades associated with inflammatory status, serum lipids, TRP, depressive symptoms, oxidative stress, anthropometrics and metabolic syndrome in individuals with BD. LEfSe identified the phylum Actinobacteria (LDA= 4.82, P = 0.007) and the class Coriobacteria (LDA= 4.75, P = 0.010) as significantly more abundant in BD when compared with HC, and Ruminococcaceae (LDA= 4.59, P = 0.018) and Faecalibacterium (LDA= 4.09, P = 0.039) as more abundant in HC when compared with BD. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that causes and/or consequences of BD may also lie outside the brain. Exploratory research of the gut microbiota in affective disorders like BD may identify previously unknown underlying causes, and offer new research and therapeutic approaches to mood disorders.",Complete,"Shaimaa Elsafoury"

Methods: Twenty-two pSS patients and 23 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Their clinical data and oral rinse samples were collected. The V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene of samples were amplified and analyzed by high-throughput sequencing on the Illumina Miseq PE300 platform. Results: Both two groups were age- and sex-matched. There were significantly higher decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) and decayed, missing and filled surfaces (DMFS) in the pSS group than in the control group (p < 0.01). Alpha diversity was depleted in pSS patients, compared with healthy controls (p < 0.01), while beta diversity between the two groups was not significantly different. Seven discriminative genera (LDA > 4) were found between the two groups in LEfSe (LDA Effect Size) analysis. The relative abundance of Veillonella in pSS patients was fourfold higher, while Actinomyces, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Rothia, Porphyromonas and Peptostreptococcus were significantly lower in pSS patients than in healthy controls. However, the correlation between Veillonella and DMFT/DMFS was not significant (p > 0.05). In Venn diagram analysis, nine genera shared by all samples of two groups, which comprised 71.88% and 67.64% in pSS patients and controls, respectively. Discussion: These findings indicate a microbial dysbiosis in pSS patients; notably, Veillonella might be recognized as a biomarker in pSS patients. The core microbiome in pSS patients was similar to the systemic healthy population.

We investigated the composition of gut microbiota in obese adolescents and adults compared to age-matched normal weight (NW) volunteers in order to assemble age- and obesity-related microbiota profiles. The composition of gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA-based metagenomics. Ecological representations of microbial communities were computed, and univariate, multivariate, and correlation analyses performed on bacterial profiles. The prediction of metagenome functional content from 16S rRNA gene surveys was carried out. Ecological analyses revealed a dissimilarity among the subgroups, and resultant microbiota profiles differed between obese adolescents and adults. Using statistical analyses, we assigned, as microbial markers, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Actinomyces to the microbiota of obese adolescents, and Parabacteroides, Rikenellaceae, Bacteroides caccae, Barnesiellaceae, and Oscillospira to the microbiota of NW adolescents. The predicted metabolic profiles resulted different in adolescent groups. Particularly, biosynthesis of primary bile acid and steroid acids, metabolism of fructose, mannose, galactose, butanoate, and pentose phosphate and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis were for the majority associated to obese, while biosynthesis and metabolism of glycan, biosynthesis of secondary bile acid, metabolism of steroid hormone and lipoic acid were associated to NW adolescents.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with abnormalities in dopamine neurotransmission and deficits in reward processing and its underlying neuro-circuitry including the ventral striatum. The microbiome might contribute to ADHD etiology via the gut-brain axis. In this pilot study, we investigated potential differences in the microbiome between ADHD cases and undiagnosed controls, as well as its relation to neural reward processing. METHODS: We used 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing (16S) to identify bacterial taxa and their predicted gene functions in 19 ADHD and 77 control participants. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we interrogated the effect of observed microbiome differences in neural reward responses in a subset of 28 participants, independent of diagnosis. RESULTS: For the first time, we describe gut microbial makeup of adolescents and adults diagnosed with ADHD. We found that the relative abundance of several bacterial taxa differed between cases and controls, albeit marginally significant. A nominal increase in the Bifidobacterium genus was observed in ADHD cases. In a hypothesis-driven approach, we found that the observed increase was linked to significantly enhanced 16S-based predicted bacterial gene functionality encoding cyclohexadienyl dehydratase in cases relative to controls. This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of phenylalanine, a precursor of dopamine. Increased relative abundance of this functionality was significantly associated with decreased ventral striatal fMRI responses during reward anticipation, independent of ADHD diagnosis and age. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show increases in gut microbiome predicted function of dopamine precursor synthesis between ADHD cases and controls. This increase in microbiome function relates to decreased neural responses to reward anticipation. Decreased neural reward anticipation constitutes one of the hallmarks of ADHD.",Complete,"Shaimaa Elsafoury"

Accumulating evidence has revealed that the gut microbiota (GM) is associated with liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, GM alterations in cholestatic infants and the correlation between the GM and hepatic functions remain uninvestigated. In this study, 43 cholestatic infants (IC group) and 37 healthy infants (H group) were enrolled to detect GM discrepancies using 16S rDNA analysis. The diversity in the bacterial community was significantly lower in the IC group than that in the H group (P = 0.013). After determining the top 10 abundant genera of microbes in the IC and H groups, we found that 13 of them were differentially enriched, including Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Staphylococcus. As compared with the H group, the IC group had a more complex GM co-occurrence network featured by three core nodes: Phyllobacterium, Ruminococcus, and Anaerostipes. In addition, the positive correlation between Faecalibacterium and Erysipelatoclostridium (r = 0.689, P = 0.000, FDR = 0.009) was not observed in the IC patients. Using the GM composition, the cholestatic patients can be distinguished from healthy infants with high accuracy [areas under receiver operating curve (AUC) > 0.97], wherein Rothia, Eggerthella, Phyllobacterium, and Blautia are identified as valuable biomarkers. Using KEGG annotation, we identified 32 functional categories with significant difference in enrichment of the GM of IC patients, including IC-enriched functional categories that were related to lipid metabolism, biodegradation and metabolism of xenobiotics, and various diseases. In contrast, the number of functions associated with amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and vitamins metabolism was reduced in the IC patients.

Using 16S rRNA gene-targeted sequencing, we evaluated taxa with differential abundance according to age- and sex-normalized body mass index (BMI z-score). Obesity was associated with an altered gut microbiota characterized by elevated levels of Firmicutes and depleted levels of Bacteroidetes. Correlation network analysis revealed that the gut microbiota of obese children also had increased correlation density and clustering of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Members of the Bacteroidetes were generally better predictors of BMI z-score and obesity than Firmicutes, which was likely due to discordant responses of Firmicutes OTUs. In accordance with these observations, the main metabolites produced by gut bacteria, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), were higher in obese children, suggesting elevated substrate utilisation.

A total of 11 OTUs belonging to the genera Enterococcus, Escherichia/Shigella, Klebsiella, Streptococcus and Peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut microbiota of CRC patients, and 5 OTUs belonging to the genus Roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family Lachnospiraceae were less abundant. Real-time quantitative PCR further validated the significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of CRC patients by measuring the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme A CoA transferase genes (Mann-Whitney test, P<0.01). Reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in CRC patients.",Complete,"Shaimaa Elsafoury"

However, little is known regarding the gut microbiota after surgical treatment. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to evaluate differences in gut microbiota among colorectal adenoma patients, CRC patients, CRC postoperative patients and healthy controls by comparing gut microbiota diversity, overall composition and taxonomic signature abundance. The gut microbiota of CRC patients, adenoma patients and healthy controls developed in accordance with the adenoma-carcinoma sequence, with impressive shifts in the gut microbiota before or during the development of CRC. The gut microbiota of postoperative patients and CRC patients differed significantly. Subdividing CRC postoperative patients according to the presence or absence of newly developed adenoma which based on the colonoscopy findings revealed that the gut microbiota of newly developed adenoma patients differed significantly from that of clean intestine patients and was more similar to the gut microbiota of carcinoma patients than to the gut microbiota of healthy controls. The alterations of the gut microbiota between the two groups of postoperative patients corresponded to CRC prognosis. More importantly, we used the different gut microbiota as biomarkers to distinguish postoperative patients with or without newly developed adenoma, achieving an AUC value of 0.72. These insights on the changes in the gut microbiota of CRC patients after surgical treatment may allow the use of the microbiota as non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of newly developed adenomas and to help prevent cancer recurrence in postoperative patients.",Complete,"Shaimaa Elsafoury"

In patients with post-exertional malaise, significant worsening of symptoms occurs following physical exertion and exercise challenge serves as a useful method for identifying biomarkers for exertion intolerance. Evidence suggests that intestinal dysbiosis and systemic responses to gut microorganisms may play a role in the symptomology of ME/CFS. As such, we hypothesized that post-exertion worsening of ME/CFS symptoms could be due to increased bacterial translocation from the intestine into the systemic circulation. To test this hypothesis, we collected symptom reports and blood and stool samples from ten clinically characterized ME/CFS patients and ten matched healthy controls before and 15 minutes, 48 hours, and 72 hours after a maximal exercise challenge. Microbiomes of blood and stool samples were examined. Stool sample microbiomes differed between ME/CFS patients and healthy controls in the abundance of several major bacterial phyla. Following maximal exercise challenge, there was an increase in relative abundance of 6 of the 9 major bacterial phyla/genera in ME/CFS patients from baseline to 72 hours post-exercise compared to only 2 of the 9 phyla/genera in controls (p = 0.005). There was also a significant difference in clearance of specific bacterial phyla from blood following exercise with high levels of bacterial sequences maintained at 72 hours post-exercise in ME/CFS patients versus clearance in the controls. These results provide evidence for a systemic effect of an altered gut microbiome in ME/CFS patients compared to controls. Upon exercise challenge, there were significant changes in the abundance of major bacterial phyla in the gut in ME/CFS patients not observed in healthy controls. In addition, compared to controls clearance of bacteria from the blood was delayed in ME/CFS patients following exercise.

To ensure sterile sampling, only deliveries at full term by elective caesarean section were studied. Microbiota composition and activity assessment by conventional bacterial culture, 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing, quantitative PCR, and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed that the placenta and amniotic fluid harbour a distinct microbiota characterised by low richness, low diversity and the predominance of Proteobacteria. Shared features between the microbiota detected in the placenta and amniotic fluid and in infant meconium suggest microbial transfer at the foeto-maternal interface.

METHODS: The first intestinal discharge (meconium) was collected from 23 newborns stratified by maternal diabetes status: 4 mothers had pre-gestational type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) including one mother with dizygotic twins, 5 developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and 13 had no diabetes. The meconium microbiome was profiled using multi-barcode 16S rRNA sequencing followed by taxonomic assignment and diversity analysis. RESULTS: All meconium samples were not sterile and contained diversified microbiota. Compared with adult feces, the meconium showed a lower species diversity, higher sample-to-sample variation, and enrichment of Proteobacteria and reduction of Bacteroidetes. Among the meconium samples, the taxonomy analyses suggested that the overall bacterial content significantly differed by maternal diabetes status, with the microbiome of the DM group showing higher alpha-diversity than that of no-diabetes or GDM groups. No global difference was found between babies delivered vaginally versus via Cesarean-section. Regression analysis showed that the most robust predictor for the meconium microbiota composition was the maternal diabetes status that preceded pregnancy. Specifically, Bacteroidetes (phyla) and Parabacteriodes (genus) were enriched in the meconium in the DM group compared to the no-diabetes group.

Work in the mouse demonstrated transmission of commensal bacteria from mother to fetus during gestation, though it is unclear what modulates this process. We have previously shown in the nonhuman primate that, independent of obesity, a maternal high-fat diet during gestation and lactation persistently shapes the juvenile gut microbiome. We therefore sought to interrogate in a population-based human longitudinal cohort whether a maternal high-fat diet similarly alters the neonatal and infant gut microbiome in early life. METHODS: A representative cohort was prospectively enrolled either in the early third trimester or intrapartum (n = 163), with a subset consented to longitudinal sampling through the postpartum interval (n = 81). Multiple body site samples, including stool and meconium, were collected from neonates at delivery and by 6 weeks of age. A rapid dietary questionnaire was administered to estimate intake of fat, added sugars, and fiber over the past month (National Health and Examination Survey). DNA was extracted from each infant meconium/stool sample (MoBio) and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing and analysis. RESULTS: On average, the maternal dietary intake of fat ranged from 14.0 to 55.2 %, with an average intake of 33.1 % (σ = 6.1 %). Mothers whose diets significantly differed from the mean (±1 standard deviation) were separated into two distinct groups, a control group (n = 13, μ = 24.4 %) and a high-fat group (n = 13, μ = 43.1 %). Principal coordinate analysis revealed that the microbiome of the neonatal stool at birth (meconium) clustered differently by virtue of maternal gestational diet (PERMANOVA p = 0.001). LEfSe feature selection identified several taxa that discriminated the groups, with a notable relative depletion of Bacteroides in the neonates exposed to a maternal high-fat gestational diet (Student's t-test, p < 0.05) that persisted to 6 weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to the primate, independent of maternal body mass index, a maternal high-fat diet is associated with distinct changes in the neonatal gut microbiome at birth which persist through 4-6 weeks of age.

METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study with 301 newborns providing meconium samples from 2014 to 2015. The main outcome was the development of neonatal jaundice at 42 day follow-up. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to profile the meconium microbiome. LEfSe was employed to identify different features between control and case groups. Logistic regression was used to estimate the risk effect of early gut microbiome on neonatal jaundice. RESULTS: Logistic regression models suggested that higher ɑ-diversity was significantly associated with lower risk of jaundice in cesarean infants (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-0.98), but not in infants born naturally. Higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium pseudolongum in newborn meconium was significantly associated with lower risk of jaundice both in cesarean-born infants and in the total subjects (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.07-0.68; OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31-0.95, respectively). Spearman's correlations showed that relative abundance of B. pseudolongum was significantly correlated with ɑ-diversity (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Preventive and treatment methods implying early gut microbiome intervention could be promising for the management of neonatal jaundice.",Complete,"Shaimaa Elsafoury"

In addition to neurological symptoms, ASD subjects frequently suffer from gastrointestinal abnormalities, thus implying a role of the gut microbiota in ASD gastrointestinal pathophysiology. RESULTS: Here, we characterized the bacterial and fungal gut microbiota in a cohort of autistic individuals demonstrating the presence of an altered microbial community structure. A fraction of 90% of the autistic subjects were classified as severe ASDs. We found a significant increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in autistic subjects due to a reduction of the Bacteroidetes relative abundance. At the genus level, we observed a decrease in the relative abundance of Alistipes, Bilophila, Dialister, Parabacteroides, and Veillonella in the ASD cohort, while Collinsella, Corynebacterium, Dorea, and Lactobacillus were significantly increased. Constipation has been then associated with different bacterial patterns in autistic and neurotypical subjects, with constipated autistic individuals characterized by high levels of bacterial taxa belonging to Escherichia/Shigella and Clostridium cluster XVIII. We also observed that the relative abundance of the fungal genus Candida was more than double in the autistic than neurotypical subjects, yet due to a larger dispersion of values, this difference was only partially significant.

Using a large cohort of Chinese adults, our study aimed to identify differences in gut microbiota as a function of body mass index (BMI) and investigate gender specific features within these differences. Methods: Five hundred fifty-one participants were categorized as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese, based on their BMI. Fecal microbiome composition was profiled via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Generalized linear model (GLM), BugBase, PICRUSt, and SPIEC-EASI were employed to assess the variabilities in richness, diversity, structure, organism-level microbiome phenotypes, molecular functions, and ecological networks of the bacterial community that associated with BMI and sex. Results: The bacterial community of the underweight group exhibited significantly higher alpha diversity than other BMI groups. When stratified by gender, the pattern of alpha diversity across BMI was maintained in females, but no significant difference in alpha diversity was detected among the BMI groups of males. An enrichment of Fusobacteria was observed in the fecal microbiota of obese males, while obese females demonstrated an increased relative abundance of Actinobacteria. Analysis of microbial community-level phenotypes revealed that underweight males tend to have more anaerobic and less facultatively anaerobic bacteria, indicating a reduced resistance to oxidative stress. Functionally, butyrate-acetoacetate CoA-transferase was enriched in obese individuals, which might favor energy accumulation. PhoH-like ATPase was found to be increased in male obese subjects, indicating a propensity to harvest energy. The microbial ecological network of the obese group contained more antagonistic microbial interactions as well as high-degree nodes. Conclusion: Using a large Chinese cohort, we demonstrated BMI-associated differences in gut microbiota composition, functions, and ecological networks, which were influenced by gender.

It has been posited that meconium reflects the in-utero microbial environment. In this study, correlations between fetal intestinal bacteria from meconium and gestational age were examined in order to suggest underlying mechanisms that may contribute to preterm birth. METHODS: Meconium from 52 infants ranging in gestational age from 23 to 41 weeks was collected, the DNA extracted, and 16S rRNA analysis performed. Resulting taxa of microbes were correlated to clinical variables and also compared to previous studies of amniotic fluid and other human microbiome niches.

Fecal calprotectin and plasma C-reactive protein levels were determined to evaluate intestinal and systemic inflammation. Furthermore, HbA1c , and plasma levels of transaminases and lipids were analyzed. Gastroduodenal, small intestinal, and colonic permeability were assessed by a multisaccharide test. RESULTS: Based on microbiota composition, the study population segregated into two clusters with predominantly obese (15/19) or exclusively nonobese (9/9) subjects. Whereas intestinal permeability did not differ between clusters, the obese cluster showed reduced bacterial diversity, a decreased Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, and an increased abundance of potential proinflammatory Proteobacteria. Interestingly, fecal calprotectin was only detectable in subjects within the obese microbiota cluster (n = 8/19, P = 0.02).

We investigated whether male and female rats previously exposed to LNS displays at weaning altered corticosterone, intestinal permeability, and microbiota. Methods: Wistar rat dams and litters were maintained from PND2 to 10 with limited nesting/bedding materials and thereafter reverted to normal housing up to weaning (PND21).

Besides rapid weight reduction, patients achieve major improvements of insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota has been associated with obesity and some of its co-morbidities, like type 2 diabetes, and major changes of gut microbial communities have been hypothesized to mediate part of the beneficial metabolic effects observed after RYGB. Here we describe changes in gut microbial taxonomic composition and functional potential following RYGB. METHODS: We recruited 13 morbidly obese patients who underwent RYGB, carefully phenotyped them, and had their gut microbiomes quantified before (n = 13) and 3 months (n = 12) and 12 months (n = 8) after RYGB. Following shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the fecal microbial DNA purified from stools, we characterized the gut microbial composition at species and gene levels followed by functional annotation. RESULTS: In parallel with the weight loss and metabolic improvements, gut microbial diversity increased within the first 3 months after RYGB and remained high 1 year later. RYGB led to altered relative abundances of 31 species (P < 0.05, q < 0.15) within the first 3 months, including those of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Veillonella spp., Streptococcus spp., Alistipes spp., and Akkermansia muciniphila. Sixteen of these species maintained their altered relative abundances during the following 9 months. Interestingly, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was the only species that decreased in relative abundance. Fifty-three microbial functional modules increased their relative abundance between baseline and 3 months (P < 0.05, q < 0.17).

The overall metagenomic RYGB-induced shift was characterized by a reduction of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and an increase of Proteobacteria. Twenty-two microbial species and 11 genera were significantly altered by RYGB. Using principal component analysis, highly correlated species were assembled into two common components. Component 1 consisted of species that were mainly associated with BMI and C-reactive protein. This component was characterized by increased numbers of Proteobacterium Enterobacter cancerogenus and decreased Firmicutes Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Coprococcus comes.

Then, it rapidly decreased and remained low up to D28 when the gut flora was composed almost exclusively of strictly anaerobic bacteria. Each infant's fecal bacterial microbiota composition was significantly closer to that of their mother than to that of any other woman in the mothers' group, suggesting an intrauterine, placental or amniotic fluid origin of such bacteria. Moreover, bacterial communities differed according to the delivery mode. Overall, the bacterial microbiota communities displayed a similar diversification and expansion in newborns within and between countries during the first four weeks of life. Moreover, six of the fifteen infants of this study harbored enteric viruses (rotavirus, enterovirus and adenovirus) in fecal samples, but never in the meconium.

Here we describe colonization and succession by bacteria, archaea and microeukaryotes during the first year of life (samples collected around days 1, 3, 5, 28, 150, and 365) within the gastrointestinal tract of infants delivered either vaginally or by cesarean section and using a combination of quantitative real-time PCR as well as 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Sequences from organisms belonging to all three domains of life were detectable in all of the collected meconium samples. The microeukaryotic community composition fluctuated strongly over time and early diversification was delayed in infants receiving formula milk. Cesarean section-delivered (CSD) infants experienced a delay in colonization and succession, which was observed for all three domains of life. Shifts in prokaryotic succession in CSD infants compared to vaginally delivered (VD) infants were apparent as early as days 3 and 5, which were characterized by increased relative abundances of the genera Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, and a decrease in relative abundance for the genera Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides. Generally, a depletion in Bacteroidetes was detected as early as day 5 postpartum in CSD infants, causing a significantly increased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio between days 5 and 150 when compared to VD infants. Although the delivery mode appeared to have the strongest influence on differences between the infants, other factors such as a younger gestational age or maternal antibiotics intake likely contributed to the observed patterns as well. Our findings complement previous observations of a delay in colonization and succession of CSD infants, which affects not only bacteria but also archaea and microeukaryotes.

To date, no microbiome studies have been performed in maturity-onset diabetes of the young 2 (MODY2), a monogenic cause of diabetes. Gut microbiota of type 1 diabetes, MODY2, and healthy control subjects was compared. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a case-control study in 15 children with type 1 diabetes, 15 children with MODY2, and 13 healthy children. Metabolic control and potential factors modifying gut microbiota were controlled. Microbiome composition was determined by 16S rRNA pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Compared with healthy control subjects, type 1 diabetes was associated with a significantly lower microbiota diversity, a significantly higher relative abundance of Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, Veillonella, Blautia, and Streptococcus genera, and a lower relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, Roseburia, Faecalibacterium, and Lachnospira. Children with MODY2 showed a significantly higher Prevotella abundance and a lower Ruminococcus and Bacteroides abundance. Proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharides were increased in type 1 diabetes, and gut permeability (determined by zonulin levels) was significantly increased in type 1 diabetes and MODY2. The PICRUSt analysis found an increment of genes related to lipid and amino acid metabolism, ABC transport, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, antigen processing and presentation, and chemokine signaling pathways in type 1 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbiota in type 1 diabetes differs at taxonomic and functional levels not only in comparison with healthy subjects but fundamentally with regard to a model of nonautoimmune diabetes. Future longitudinal studies should be aimed at evaluating if the modulation of gut microbiota in patients with a high risk of type 1 diabetes could modify the natural history of this autoimmune disease.",Complete,"Shaimaa Elsafoury"

The aim of this work is to study microbiota changes in the course of weight loss therapy and the following year in obese individuals with or without co-morbidities, and to asses a possible predictive value of the gut microbiota with regard to weight loss maintenance. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Sixteen adult patients, who followed a 52-week weight-loss program comprising low calorie diet, exercise and behavioral therapy, were selected according to their weight-loss course. Over two years, anthropometric and metabolic parameters were assessed and microbiota from stool samples was functionally and taxonomically analyzed using DNA shotgun sequencing. RESULTS: Overall the microbiota responded to the dietetic and lifestyle intervention but tended to return to the initial situation both at the taxonomical and functional level at the end of the intervention after one year, except for an increase in Akkermansia abundance which remained stable over two years (12.7x103 counts, 95%CI: 322-25100 at month 0; 141x103 counts, 95%CI: 49-233x103 at month 24; p = 0.005).

We identified obesity-associated gut microbial species linked to changes in circulating metabolites.

Consistently, gavage with B. thetaiotaomicron reduced plasma glutamate concentration and alleviated diet-induced body-weight gain and adiposity in mice. Furthermore, weight-loss intervention by bariatric surgery partially reversed obesity-associated microbial and metabolic alterations in obese individuals, including the decreased abundance of B. thetaiotaomicron and the elevated serum glutamate concentration.

It has been reported that the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genus representatives may have a critical role in weight regulation as an anti-obesity effect in experimental models and humans, or as a growth-promoter effect in agriculture depending on the strains. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: To confirm reported gut alterations and test whether Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium species found in the human gut are associated with obesity or lean status, we analyzed the stools of 68 obese and 47 controls targeting Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium animalis and seven species of Lactobacillus by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and culture on a Lactobacillus-selective medium. FINDINGS: In qPCR, B. animalis (odds ratio (OR)=0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39-1.01; P=0.056) and M. smithii (OR=0.76; 95% CI 0.59-0.97; P=0.03) were associated with normal weight whereas Lactobacillus reuteri (OR=1.79; 95% CI 1.03-3.10; P=0.04) was associated with obesity. CONCLUSION: The gut microbiota associated with human obesity is depleted in M. smithii. Some Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus species were associated with normal weight (B. animalis) while others (L. reuteri) were associated with obesity. Therefore, gut microbiota composition at the species level is related to body weight and obesity, which might be of relevance for further studies and the management of obesity.

Our aim was to quantify and evaluate the difference in the composition of gut microbiota between children with type 1 diabetes and healthy children and to determine the possible relationship of the gut microbiota of children with type 1 diabetes with the glycemic level. METHODS: A case-control study was carried out with 16 children with type 1 diabetes and 16 healthy children. The fecal bacteria composition was investigated by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The mean similarity index was 47.39% for the healthy children and 37.56% for the children with diabetes, whereas the intergroup similarity index was 26.69%. In the children with diabetes, the bacterial number of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, and the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio were all significantly decreased, with the quantity of Bacteroidetes significantly increased with respect to healthy children. At the genus level, we found a significant increase in the number of Clostridium, Bacteroides and Veillonella and a significant decrease in the number of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Blautia coccoides/Eubacterium rectale group and Prevotella in the children with diabetes. We also found that the number of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio correlated negatively and significantly with the plasma glucose level while the quantity of Clostridium correlated positively and significantly with the plasma glucose level in the diabetes group. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study showing that type 1 diabetes is associated with compositional changes in gut microbiota. The significant differences in the number of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus and Clostridium and in the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio observed between the two groups could be related to the glycemic level in the group with diabetes. Moreover, the quantity of bacteria essential to maintain gut integrity was significantly lower in the children with diabetes than the healthy children. These findings could be useful for developing strategies to control the development of type 1 diabetes by modifying the gut microbiota.",Complete,"Shaimaa Elsafoury"

We compared oropharyngeal microbiota of elderly pneumonia patients (n=100) with healthy elderly (n=91) by 16S-rRNA-based sequencing and verified our findings in young adult pneumonia patients (n=27) and young healthy adults (n=187). Microbiota profiles differed significantly between elderly pneumonia patients and healthy elderly (PERMANOVA, P<0.0005). Highly similar differences were observed between microbiota profiles of young adult pneumonia patients and their healthy controls. Clustering resulted in 11 (sub)clusters including 95% (386/405) of samples. We observed three microbiota profiles strongly associated with pneumonia (P<0.05) and either dominated by lactobacilli (n=11), Rothia (n=51) or Streptococcus (pseudo)pneumoniae (n=42). In contrast, three other microbiota clusters (in total n=183) were correlated with health (P<0.05) and were all characterized by more diverse profiles containing higher abundances of especially Prevotella melaninogenica, Veillonella and Leptotrichia. For the remaining clusters (n=99), the association with health or disease was less clear. A decision tree model based on the relative abundance of five bacterial community members in URT microbiota showed high specificity of 95% and sensitivity of 84% (89% and 73%, respectively, after cross-validation) for differentiating pneumonia patients from healthy individuals. These results suggest that pneumonia in elderly and young adults is associated with dysbiosis of the URT microbiome with bacterial overgrowth of single species and absence of distinct anaerobic bacteria. Whether the observed microbiome changes are a cause or a consequence of the development of pneumonia or merely coincide with disease status remains a question for future research.",Complete,

The V3-V4 regions of 16S rRNA gene were analyzed by Illumina sequencing, and clinical information was obtained from medical records and questionnaire survey. Compared with vaginally delivered infants, the gut microbial community structure of cesarean delivered infants were significantly different (P = 0.044), in parallel with the decreased relative abundance of Bifidobacterium (P = 0.028), which contrasts with the normal gut microbial establishment. Using the vaginally delivered and exclusively breastfed (VB) infants as a reference, the comparative analysis of cesarean delivered and exclusively breastfed (CB) infants with cesarean delivered and mixed-fed (CM) infants showed that both within- and between-group UniFrac distance were significantly smaller in CB infants (P < 0.001, P < 0.001). LEfSe analysis showed that the relative abundances of Enterococcus, Veillonella, and Faecalibacterium were significantly different between CB and CM infants, whereas the relative abundances of those genera in VB infants were close to those of CB infants, and distinct from those of CM infants. Additionally, no significant difference of microbial composition, alpha diversity, or community structure was observed between postnatal antibiotics exposed infants and unexposed infants. In summary, delivery mode had a significant impact on the infant gut microbial community structure and composition, and the gut microbiota was disturbed in infants delivered by cesarean section. However, our study showed that this disturbance of gut microbiota in cesarean delivered infants was partially restored by exclusive breastfeeding in comparison with mixed feeding.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that variability in gut microbiota in T2D is associated with psycho-metabolic health. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among African American men (AAM) (n = 99) that were outpatients at a Chicago VA Medical Center. The main outcome measures included fecal microbiota ecology (by 16S rRNA gene sequencing), psychiatric disorders including opioid use, and circulating leptin and oxytocin as representative hormone biomarkers for obesity and psychological pro-social behavior. RESULTS: The study subjects had prevalent overweight/obesity (78%), T2D (50%) and co-morbid psychiatric (65%) and opioid use (45%) disorders. In the analysis of microbiota, the data showed interactions of opioids, T2D and metformin with Bifidobacterium and Prevotella genera. The differential analysis of Bifidobacterium stratified by opioids, T2D and metformin, showed significant interactions among these factors indicating that the effect of one factor was changed by the other (FDR-adjusted p [q] < 0.01). In addition, the pair-wise comparison showed that participants with T2D not taking metformin had a significant 6.74 log2 fold increase in Bifidobacterium in opioid users as compared to non-users (q = 2.2 x 10-8). Since metformin was not included in this pair-wise comparison, the significant 'q' suggested association of opioid use with Bifidobacterium abundance. The differences in Bifidobacterium abundance could possibly be explained by opioids acting as organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) inhibitors. Analysis stratified by lower and higher leptin and oxytocin (divided by the 50th percentile) in the subgroup without T2D showed lower Dialister in High-Leptin vs. Low-Leptin (p = 0.03).

The human microbiota refers to the collection of microbes inhabiting the human body. Imbalance in microbial communities, or microbial dysbiosis, has been implicated in various human diseases including obesity, diabetes, and colon cancer. Therefore, we investigated the potential role of microbiota in breast cancer by next-generation sequencing using breast tumor tissue and paired normal adjacent tissue from the same patient. In a qualitative survey of the breast microbiota DNA, we found that the bacterium Methylobacterium radiotolerans is relatively enriched in tumor tissue, while the bacterium Sphingomonas yanoikuyae is relatively enriched in paired normal tissue. The relative abundances of these two bacterial species were inversely correlated in paired normal breast tissue but not in tumor tissue, indicating that dysbiosis is associated with breast cancer. Furthermore, the total bacterial DNA load was reduced in tumor versus paired normal and healthy breast tissue as determined by quantitative PCR. Interestingly, bacterial DNA load correlated inversely with advanced disease, a finding that could have broad implications in diagnosis and staging of breast cancer. Lastly, we observed lower basal levels of antibacterial response gene expression in tumor versus healthy breast tissue. Taken together, these data indicate that microbial DNA is present in the breast and that bacteria or their components may influence the local immune microenvironment. Our findings suggest a previously unrecognized link between dysbiosis and breast cancer which has potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",Complete,

OBJECTIVE: This study compared fecal microbiota characteristics using high-throughput sequencing among healthy sedentary men (as controls), bodybuilders, and distance runners, as well as the relationships between microbiota characteristics, body composition, and nutritional status. METHODS: Body composition was measured using DXA, and physical activity level was assessed using IPAQ. Dietary intake was analyzed with the computerized nutritional evaluation program. The DNA of fecal samples was extracted and it was sequenced for the analysis of gut microbial diversity through bioinformatics cloud platform. RESULTS: We showed that exercise type was associated with athlete diet patterns (bodybuilders: high protein, high fat, low carbohydrate, and low dietary fiber diet; distance runners: low carbohydrate and low dietary fiber diet). However, athlete type did not differ in regard to gut microbiota alpha and beta diversity. Athlete type was significantly associated with the relative abundance of gut microbiota at the genus and species level: Faecalibacterium, Sutterella, Clostridium, Haemophilus, and Eisenbergiella were the highest (p < 0.05) in bodybuilders, while Bifidobacterium and Parasutterella were the lowest (p < 0.05). At the species level, intestinal beneficial bacteria widely used as probiotics (Bifidobacterium adolescentis group, Bifidobacterium longum group, Lactobacillus sakei group) and those producing short chain fatty acids (Blautia wexlerae, Eubacterium hallii) were the lowest in bodybuilders and the highest in controls. In addition, aerobic or resistance exercise training with an unbalanced intake of macronutrients and low intake of dietary fiber led to similar diversity of gut microbiota. Specifically, daily protein intake was negatively correlated with operation taxonomic unit (r = - 0.53, p < 0.05), ACE (r = - 0.51, p < 0.05), and Shannon index (r = - 0.64, p < 0.01) in distance runners..

The mushroom-rich diet resulted in higher average stool weight (p = 0.002) and a different fecal microbiota composition compared to the meat diet, with greater abundance of Bacteroidetes (p = 0.0002) and lower abundance of Firmicutes (p = 0.0009). The increase in stool weight and presence of undigested mushrooms in stool suggests that mushroom consumption may impact laxation in healthy adults. Additional research is needed to interpret the health implications of fecal microbiota shifts with mushroom feeding.",Complete,"Shaimaa Elsafoury"

It is beneficial to health; however, equol-producing ability varies greatly among individuals. These variations depend on the host's gut microbiota and lifestyle habits including diet. We investigated the relationship between the gut microbiota, lifestyle habits including diet, and equol-producing ability in postmenopausal Japanese women. METHODS: We studied 58 postmenopausal Japanese women aged 48 to 69 years who visited the Sendai Medical Center in January, 2018. Self-administered questionnaires assessed their recent and remote food intake histories and lifestyle habits. Fecal microbiome analysis was performed using a next-generation sequencer. Urinary equol was measured using an immunochromatographic strip test. Women with urinary equol concentration >1.0 μM were defined as equol producers. RESULTS: Equol-producing bacteria were identified in 97% (56) of women; however, only 13 (22%) were equol producers. Equol producers showed significantly higher microflora diversity (P = 0.002), and significantly different recent and remote food intake patterns compared with equol nonproducers. Higher consumption of foods such as meat, fish, soy, vegetables, and Japanese snacks positively affected microbial diversity and equol production, whereas a high intake of Ramen and smoking showed negative effects. CONCLUSION: Equol production might not depend on the quantity, but on the quality of equol-producing bacteria. High microbial diversity might enhance equol production. Increasing microbial diversity through healthy lifestyle habits and habitual consumption of a wide variety of foods might be useful to maintain a healthy gut environment for equol production.",Complete,

Design, Setting, and Participants: This nested case-control study was carried out in 2 prospective cohort studies: the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort (CPS-II) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). Among 122 004 participants, 129 incident patient cases of HNSCC were identified during an average 3.9 years of follow-up. Two controls per patient case (n = 254) were selected through incidence density sampling, matched on age, sex, race/ethnicity, and time since mouthwash collection. All participants provided mouthwash samples and were cancer-free at baseline. Exposures: Oral microbiome composition and specific bacterial abundances were determined through bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Overall oral microbiome composition and specific taxa abundances were compared for the case group and the control group, using PERMANOVA and negative binomial generalized linear models, respectively, controlling for age, sex, race, cohort, smoking, alcohol, and oral human papillomavirus-16 status. Taxa with a 2-sided false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted P-value (q-value) <.10 were considered significant. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident HNSCC. Results: The study included 58 patient cases from CPS-II (mean [SD] age, 71.0 [6.4] years; 16 [27.6%] women) and 71 patient cases from PLCO (mean [SD] age, 62.7 [4.8] years; 13 [18.3%] women).

These findings were consistent for both cohorts and by cohort follow-up time. The observed relationships tended to be stronger for larynx cancer and for individuals with a history of tobacco use.

The bacterial profile of Crohn's disease mesenteric lymph nodes has been analysed using culture-independent methods in only one previous study. This study aimed to investigate the mesenteric lymph node microbiota from both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Methods: Mesenteric lymph nodes were collected from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients undergoing resection. Total DNA was extracted from mesenteric lymph nodes and assessed for the presence of bacterial DNA [16S]. All work was completed in a sterile environment using aseptic techniques. Samples positive for 16S DNA underwent next-generation sequencing, and the identity of bacterial phyla and species were determined. Results: Crohn's disease mesenteric lymph nodes had a distinctly different microbial profile to that observed in ulcerative colitis. The relative abundance of Firmicutes was greater in nodes from ulcerative colitis patients, whereas Proteobacteria were more abundant in Crohn's disease. Although species diversity was reduced in the mesenteric lymph nodes of patients with Crohn's disease, these lymph nodes contained greater numbers of less dominant phyla, mainly Fusobacteria. Conclusion: This study confirms that there are distinct differences between the Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis mesenteric lymph node microbiomes.

We assessed that the composition of the gut microbial communities in NIR-PCOS and IR-PCOS patients were significantly altered. The family Bacteroidaceae was prolific in the NIR-PCOS group and reached its highest level in the IR-PCOS group, while the Prevotellaceae dramatically decreased in PCOS patients, especially in the IR-PCOS group. Subsequent correlation analysis revealed that the increased clinical parameter levels, including insulin resistance, sex-hormones and inflammation, were positively associated with the abundance of Bacteroidaceae, but negatively associated with that of Prevotellaceae. In addition, IR-PCOS patients also displayed a significant difference in their amounts of Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae when compared to the NIR-PCOS group.

The composition and functional capacity of gut microbiota associated with breast cancer have not been studied systematically. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive shotgun metagenomic analysis of 18 premenopausal breast cancer patients, 25 premenopausal healthy controls, 44 postmenopausal breast cancer patients, and 46 postmenopausal healthy controls. RESULTS: Microbial diversity was higher in breast cancer patients than in controls. Relative species abundance in gut microbiota did not differ significantly between premenopausal breast cancer patients and premenopausal controls. In contrast, relative abundance of 45 species differed significantly between postmenopausal patients and postmenopausal controls: 38 species were enriched in postmenopausal patients, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp_1_1_55, Prevotella amnii, Enterococcus gallinarum, Actinomyces sp. HPA0247, Shewanella putrefaciens, and Erwinia amylovora, and 7 species were less abundant in postmenopausal patients, including Eubacterium eligens and Lactobacillus vaginalis. Acinetobacter radioresistens and Enterococcus gallinarum were positively but weakly associated with expression of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; Shewanella putrefaciens and Erwinia amylovora were positively but weakly associated with estradiol levels. Actinomyces sp. HPA0247 negatively but weakly correlated with CD3+CD8+ T cell numbers. Further characterization of metagenome functional capacity indicated that the gut metagenomes of postmenopausal breast cancer patients were enriched in genes encoding lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, iron complex transport system, PTS system, secretion system, and beta-oxidation. CONCLUSION: The composition and functions of the gut microbial community differ between postmenopausal breast cancer patients and healthy controls.

In the present study, we conducted 16S ribosomal DNA pyrosequencing using fecal microbiota samples and analyzed the production of serum inflammatory factors in 50 patients with CKD and 22 healthy control (HC) subjects. The results revealed that compared to the HC subjects, patients with CKD exhibited a significant reduction in the richness and structure of their fecal microbiota.

Moreover, the genera Lactobacillus, Clostridium IV, Paraprevotella, Clostridium sensu stricto, Desulfovibrio, and Alloprevotella were enriched in the fecal samples of patients with CKD, while Akkermansia and Parasutterella were enriched in those of the HC subjects. The abundance of Akkermansia in the CKD group was significantly lower than that in the HC group (3.08 vs. 0.67%); this decrease in the abundance of Akkermansia, an important probiotic, in patients with CKD is a striking discovery as it has not been previously reported.

Altered levels of the microbiota genera Parasutterella, Lactobacillus, Paraprevotella, Clostridium sensu stricto, and Desulfovibrio were shown to be correlated with CKD disease-severity indicators, including the estimated glomerular filtration rate.

We selected a bacterial marker panel of three bacteria (upregulated F. periodonticum, down-regulated S. mitis, and P. pasteri), which had an AUC of 0.956 (95% CI = 0.925-0.986) in discriminating OSCC stage 4 from the healthy controls. Furthermore, the functional prediction of oral bacterial communities showed that genes involved in carbohydrate-related metabolism, such as methane metabolism, and energy-metabolism-related parameters, such as oxidative phosphorylation and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, were enriched in late-stage OSCC, while those responsible for amino acid metabolism, such as folate biosynthesis and valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis, were significantly associated with the healthy controls. In conclusion, our results provided evidence of oral bacteria community changes during oral cancer progression and suggested the possibility of using bacteria as OSCC diagnostic markers.",Complete,

METHODS: Tongue coating samples were collected from 53 CHB patients (28 CHB yellow tongue coating patients and 25 CHB white tongue coating patients) and 22 healthy controls. Microbial DNA was extracted from the tongue samples, and the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene V3 region was amplified from all samples and sequenced with the Ion Torrent PGM™ sequencing platform according to the standard protocols. The metabolites in the tongue coatings were evaluated using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platform. Statistical analyses were then performed. RESULTS: The relative compositions of the tongue coating microbiotas and metabolites in the CHB patients were significantly different from those of the healthy controls, but the tongue coating microbiota abundances and diversity levels were not significantly different. Compared with the CHB white tongue coating patients, the CHB yellow tongue coating patients had higher hepatitis B viral DNA (HBV-DNA) titers (median 21210 vs 500, respectively, P = 0.03) and a significantly lower level of Bacteroidetes (20.14% vs 27.93%, respectively, P = 0.013) and higher level of Proteobacteria (25.99% vs 18.17%, respectively, P = 0.045) in the microbial compositions at the phylum level. The inferred metagenomic pathways enriched in the CHB yellow tongue coating patients were mainly those involved in amino acid metabolism, which was consistent with the metabolic disorder. The abundances of bacteria from Bacteroidales at the order level were higher in the CHB white tongue coating patients (19.2% vs 27.22%, respectively, P = 0.011), whereas Neisseriales were enriched in the yellow tongue coating patients (21.85% vs 13.83%, respectively, P = 0.029). At the family level, the abundance of Neisseriaceae in the yellow tongue patients was positively correlated with the HBV-DNA level but negatively correlated with the S-adenosyl-L-methionine level.

Our goal was to examine the association between urinary and fecal microbial profiles and the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PC) in patients undergoing transrectal biopsy of the prostate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We extracted total DNA from urine and fecal samples collected before a prostate biopsy performed for elevated prostatic specific antigen in patients suspected of having PC. We then amplified the extracted DNA and sequenced it using bacterial 16S rRNA gene high-throughput next-generation sequencing platform, and analyzed microbial profiles for taxonomy comparing those patients diagnosed with PC with those who did not receive that diagnosis. RESULTS: We included 30 patients in our analysis (60 samples, one urine and one fecal per patient). The majority of patients with PC (10/14) had similar bacterial communities within their urinary sample profile and clustered separately than patients without cancer (n = 16). Differential analysis of the operational taxonomical units (OTUs) in urine samples revealed decreased abundance of several bacterial species in patients with prostate cancer. Analysis of the bacterial taxonomies of the fecal samples did not reveal any clustering in concordance with benign or malignant prostate biopsies. Patients who had a Gleason score (GS) of 6 (n = 11) were present in both urine bacterial community clusters, but patients with GS 7 or higher (n = 3) did not cluster tightly with non-cancer subjects.

Although some studies have reported the effect of long-term follow-up after subtotal gastrectomy on intestinal flora changes in patients with GC. However, the features of gut microbiota and their shifts in patients with GC in perioperative period remain unclear.This study was designed to characterize fecal microbiota shifts of the patients with GC before and after the radical distal gastrectomy (RDG) during their hospital staying periods. Furthermore, fecal microbiota was also compared between the GC patients and healthy individuals.Patients who were diagnosed with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma at distal stomach were enrolled in the study. The bacterial burden within fecal samples was determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. To analyze the diversity and composition of gut microbiota from fecal DNA of 20 GC patients and 22 healthy controls, amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene from all subjects were pyrosequenced. To study gut microbiota shifts, the fecal microbiota from 6 GC patients before and after RDG was detected and subsequently analyzed. Short-chain fatty acids were also detected by chromatography spectrometer in these 6 GC patients.RDG had a moderate effect on bacterial richness and evenness, but had pronounced effects on the composition of postoperative gut microbiota compared with preoperative group. The relative abundances of genera Akkermansia, Esherichia/Shigella, Lactobacillus, and Dialister were significant changed in perioperative period. Remarkably, higher abundances of Escherichia/Shigella, Veillonella, and Clostridium XVIII and lower abundances of Bacteroides were observed in gut microbiota of overall GC patients compared to healthy controls.This study is the first study to characterize the altered gut microbiota within fecal samples from GC patients during perioperative period, and provide a new insights on such microbial perturbations as a potential effector of perioperative period phenotype. Further research must validate these discoveries and may evaluate targeted microbiota shifts to improve outcomes in GC patients.",Complete,

There were no specific microbial species in the CA group or NCA group. However, many species, such as those in the genera Alkaliphilus, Enterobacter, Lactococcus, Cronobacter, Carnobacterium, and Streptococcus, showed a significant difference between the CA group and NCA group.

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London. POPULATION: Twenty singleton pregnancies undergoing a rescue cervical cerclage. METHODS: Vaginal microbiota composition was analysed in women presenting with a dilated cervix and exposed fetal membranes before and 10 days following rescue cervical cerclage and was correlated with clinical outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Composition of vaginal bacteria was characterised by culture-independent next generation sequencing. Successful cerclage was defined as that resulting in the birth of a neonate discharged from hospital without morbidity. Unsuccessful cerclage was defined as procedures culminating in miscarriage, intrauterine death, neonatal death or significant neonatal morbidity. RESULTS: Reduced Lactobacillus spp. relative abundance was observed in 40% of cases prior to rescue cerclage compared with 10% of gestation age-matched controls (8/20, 40% versus 3/30, 10%, P = 0.017). Gardnerella vaginalis was over-represented in women presenting with symptoms (3/7, 43% versus 0/13, 0%, P = 0.03, linear discriminant analysis, LDA (log 10) and cases culminating in miscarriage (3/6, 50% versus 0/14, 0%, P = 0.017). In the majority of cases (10/14, 71%) bacterial composition was unchanged following cerclage insertion and perioperative interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. is associated with premature cervical dilation, whereas high levels of G. vaginalis are associated with unsuccessful rescue cerclage cases. The insertion of a rescue cerclage does not affect the underlying bacterial composition in the majority of cases.

Previous evidence has indicated that the dysbiosis of gut microbiota occurs after liver virus infection and is associated with severe liver disease. The aim of this study is to elucidate the compositional and functional characteristics of the gut microbiota in early-stage CHB and to understand their influence on disease progression. We investigated the gut microbial composition of stool samples from 85 CHB patients with low Child-Pugh scores and 22 healthy controls using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Furthermore, the serum metabolome of 40 subjects was measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Compared with the controls, significant alteration in the gut microbiota was observed in the CHB patients; 5 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to Actinomyces, Clostridium sensu stricto, unclassified Lachnospiraceae and Megamonas were increased, and 27 belonging to Alistipes, Asaccharobacter, Bacteroides, Butyricimonas, Clostridium IV, Escherichia/Shigella, Parabacteroides, Ruminococcus, unclassified Bacteria, unclassified Clostridiales, Unclassified Coriobacteriaceae, unclassified Enterobacteriaceae, unclassified Lachnospiraceae and unclassified Ruminococcaceae were decreased. The inferred metagenomic information of gut microbiota in CHB showed 21 enriched and 17 depleted KEGG level-2 pathways. Four OTUs, OTU38 (Streptococcus), OTU124 (Veillonella), OTU224 (Streptococcus), and OTU55 (Haemophilus), had high correlations with hosts' hepatic function indices and 10 serum metabolites, including phenylalanine and tyrosine, which are aromatic amino acids that play pathogenic roles in liver disease. In particular, these 4 OTUs were significantly higher in patients with higher Child-Pugh scores, who also showed diminished phenylalanine and tryptophan metabolisms in the inferred gut metagenomic functions. These compositional and functional changes in the gut microbiota in early-stage CHB patients suggest the potential contributions of gut microbiota to the progression of CHB, and thus provide new insight into gut microbiota-targeted interventions to improve the prognosis of this disease.",Complete,

We tested 28 chemical exposures: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated flame retardants (PBDEs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and organochlorine pesticides. We assessed chemical exposure and alpha diversity/SCFAs using elastic net regression modeling and generalized linear models, adjusting for confounders, and variation in beta diversity (UniFrac), taxa abundance (ANCOM), and predicted metagenomes (PiCRUSt) in low, medium, and high exposed groups. RESULTS: PBDE-28 and the surfactant perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were associated with less microbiome diversity. Some sub-OTUs of Lactobacillus, an important genus in early life, were lower in abundance in samples from infants with relative ""high"" (> 80th percentile) vs. ""low"" (< 20th percentile) toxicant exposure in this cohort. Moreover, breast milk toxicants were associated with microbiome functionality, explaining up to 34% of variance in acetic and propionic SCFAs, essential signaling molecules. Per one standard deviation of exposure, PBDE-28 was associated with less propionic acid (- 24% [95% CI - 35% to - 14%] relative to the mean), and PCB-209 with less acetic acid (- 15% [95% CI - 29% to - 0.4%]).

But the mechanisms have not been completely explained. This study was designed to analyze the gut microbiota in children with VVS and explore its clinical significance. METHODS: Fecal samples from 20 VVS children and 20 matched controls were collected, and the microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The diversity and microbiota compositions of the VVS cases and controls were compared with the independent sample t test or Mann-Whitney U test. The correlation between the predominant bacteria and clinical symptoms was analyzed using Pearson or Spearman correlation test. RESULTS: No significant differences in diversity were evident between VVS and controls (P > 0.05). At the family level, the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae was significantly higher in VVS children than in controls (median [Q1, Q3]: 22.10% [16.89%, 27.36%] vs. 13.92% [10.31%, 20.18%], Z = -2.40, P < 0.05), and LEfSe analysis revealed Ruminococcaceae as a discriminative feature (linear discriminant analysis [LDA] score > 4, P < 0.05). The relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae in VVS patients was positively correlated with the frequency of syncope (r = 0.616, P < 0.01). In terms of its correlation with hemodynamics, we showed that relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae was negatively correlated with the systolic and diastolic pressure reduction at the positive response in head-up tilt test (HUTT; r = -0.489 and -0.448, all P < 0.05), but was positively correlated with the mean pressure drop and decline rate (r = 0.489 and 0.467, all P < 0.05) as well as diastolic pressure drop and decline rate at the HUTT positive response (r = 0.579 and 0.589, all P < 0.01) in VVS patients.

DESIGN: Nested case-control study in 3D cohort (design, develop, discover). SETTING: Quebec, Canada. SAMPLE: Ninety-four women with spontaneous preterm birth as cases [17 early (<34 weeks) and 77 late (34-36 weeks) preterm birth] and 356 women as controls with term delivery (≥37 weeks). METHODS: To assess the vaginal microbiome by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene in swabs self-collected during early pregnancy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Comparison of relative abundance of bacterial operational taxonomic units and oligotypes and identifying vaginal community state types (CSTs) in early or late spontaneous preterm and term deliveries. RESULTS: Lactobacillus gasseri/ Lactobacillus johnsonii (coefficient -5.36, 95% CI -8.07 to -2.65), Lactobacillus crispatus (99%)/ Lactobacillus acidophilus (99%) (-4.58, 95% CI -6.20 to -2.96), Lactobacillus iners (99%)/ Ralstonia solanacearum (99%) (-3.98, 95% CI -6.48 to -1.47) and Bifidobacterium longum/ Bifidobacterium breve (-8.84, 95% CI -12.96 to -4.73) were associated with decreased risk of early but not late preterm birth. Six vaginal CSTs were identified: four dominated by Lactobacillus; one with presence of bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria (Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae and Veillonellaceae bacterium) (CST IV); and one with nondominance of Lactobacillus (CST VI). CST IV was associated with increased risk of early (4.22, 95% CI 1.24-24.85) but not late (1.63, 95% CI 0.68-5.04) preterm birth, compared with CST VI. CONCLUSIONS: Lactobacillus gasseri/L. johnsonii, L. crispatus/L. acidophilus, L. iners/R. solanacearum and B. longum/B. breve may be associated with decreased risk of early preterm birth.

The alteration of vaginal microbiota affects millions of women annually, and is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. However, previous studies have primarily focused on the association between bacterial vaginosis and HPV infection. Little is known about the composition of vaginal microbial communities involved in HPV acquisition. The present study was performed to investigate whether HPV infection was associated with the diversity and composition of vaginal microbiota. METHODS: A total of 70 healthy women (32 HPV-negative and 38 HPV-positive) with normal cervical cytology were enrolled in this study. Culture-independent polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to measure the diversity and composition of vaginal microbiota of all subjects. RESULTS: We found significantly greater biological diversity in the vaginal microbiota of HPV-positive women (p < 0.001). Lactobacillus, including L. gallinarum, L. iners and L. gasseri, was the predominant genus and was detected in all women. No significant difference between HPV-positive and HPV-negative women was found for the frequency of detection of L. gallinarum (p = 0.775) or L. iners (p = 0.717), but L. gasseri was found at a significantly higher frequency in HPV-positive women (p = 0.005). Gardnerella vaginalis was also found at a significantly higher frequency in HPV-positive women (p = 0.031). Dendrograms revealed that vaginal microbiota from the two groups had different profiles. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first systematic evaluation of an association between vaginal microbiota and HPV infection, and we have demonstrated that compared with HPV-negative women, the bacterial diversity of HPV-positive women is more complex and the composition of vaginal microbiota is different.",Complete,Claregrieve1

The overall composition of the microbiota was similar between the patients with gastritis and those with intestinal metaplasia. H. pylori was present in half of the non-cancer group, and the dominant bacterial species in the H. pylori-negative patients were Burkholderia, Enterobacter, and Leclercia. The abundance of those bacteria was similar between the cancer and non-cancer groups, whereas the frequency and abundance of H. pylori were significantly lower in the cancer group. Instead, Clostridium, Fusobacterium, and Lactobacillus species were frequently abundant in patients with gastric cancer, demonstrating a gastric cancer-specific bacterial signature.

Increasing evidences showed that the distribution of HCC was related to the incidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and other factors, such as alcoholism, aflatoxin B1 ingestion and obesity. Recent studies demonstrated that gut dysbiosis plays an important role in liver diseases. However, the researches on gut microbiota of HBV and non-HBV non-HCV related HCC have not been reported. In this study, we investigated the differences between the gut microbiota of HBV related HCC (B-HCC) and non-HBV non-HCV related HCC (NBNC-HCC), finally found some potential bacteria, linking different pathological mechanism of both types of HCCs. Results: We carried out 16S rRNA analyses in a cohort of 33 healthy controls, 35 individuals with HBV related HCC (B-HCC) and 22 individuals with non-HBV non-HCV (NBNC) related HCC (NBNC-HCC). We found that the species richness of fecal microbiota of B-HCC patients was much higher than other two groups. Interestingly, the feces of NBNC-HCC patients harbored more potential pro-inflammatory bacteria (Escherichia-Shigella, Enterococcus) and reduced levels of Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, Ruminoclostridium which results in decrease potential of anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids. The feces of NBNC-HCC patients had relatively fewer abundance of multiple biological pathways related to amino acid and glucose metabolism, but high level of transport and secretion in some types. However, the B-HCC patients had opposite results of bacterial composition and associated multiple biological pathways versus NBNC-HCC patients. Meanwhile, we found that aberrant network of gut microbiota occurred differently in B-HCC and NBNC-HCC patients. Conclusions: Our study indicated that B-HCC and NBNC-HCC patients showed differential abundance of bacteria involved in different functions or biological pathways. We suggested the modification of specific gut microbiota may provide the therapeutic benefit for B-HCC and NBNC-HCC.",Complete,Claregrieve1

Almonds are a rich source of fiber, unsaturated fats, and polyphenols, all nutrients that can favorably alter the gut microbiome. Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of 8 wk of almond snacking on the gut (fecal) microbiome diversity and abundance compared with an isocaloric snack of graham crackers in college freshmen. Methods: A randomized, controlled, parallel-arm, 8-wk intervention in 73 college freshmen (age: 18-19 y; 41 women and 32 men; BMI: 18-41 kg/m2) with no cardiometabolic disorders was conducted. Participants were randomly allocated to either an almond snack group (56.7 g/d; 364 kcal; n = 38) or graham cracker control group (77.5 g/d; 338 kcal/d; n = 35). Stool samples were collected at baseline and 8 wk after the intervention to assess primary microbiome outcomes, that is, gut microbiome diversity and abundance. Results: Almond snacking resulted in 3% greater quantitative alpha-diversity (Shannon index) and 8% greater qualitative alpha-diversity (Chao1 index) than the cracker group after the intervention (P < 0.05). Moreover, almond snacking for 8 wk decreased the abundance of the pathogenic bacterium Bacteroides fragilis by 48% (overall relative abundance, P < 0.05).

We conducted a randomized cross-over trial with four-week treatments in which 28 healthy humans consumed a daily dose of 60 g of whole-grain barley (WGB), brown rice (BR), or an equal mixture of the two (BR+WGB), and characterized their impact on fecal microbial ecology and blood markers of inflammation, glucose and lipid metabolism.

Here we test the prediction that HIV infection modifies the composition and function of the mucosal commensal microbiota. RESULTS: Rectal mucosal microbiota were collected from human subjects using a sponge-based sampling methodology. Samples were collected from 20 HIV-positive men not receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART), 20 HIV-positive men on cART and 20 healthy, HIV-negative men. Microbial composition of samples was analyzed using barcoded 16S Illumina deep sequencing (85,900 reads per sample after processing). Microbial metagenomic information for the samples was imputed using the bioinformatic tools PICRUST and HUMAnN. Microbial composition and imputed function in HIV-positive individuals not receiving cART was significantly different from HIV-negative individuals. Genera including Roseburia, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus, Eubacterium, Alistipes and Lachnospira were depleted in HIV-infected subjects not receiving cART, while Fusobacteria, Anaerococcus, Peptostreptococcus and Porphyromonas were significantly enriched. HIV-positive subjects receiving cART exhibited similar depletion and enrichment for these genera, but were of intermediate magnitude and did not achieve statistical significance. Imputed metagenomic functions, including amino acid metabolism, vitamin biosynthesis, and siderophore biosynthesis differed significantly between healthy controls and HIV-infected subjects not receiving cART. CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection was associated with rectal mucosal changes in microbiota composition and imputed function that cART failed to completely reverse. HIV infection was associated with depletion of some commensal species and enrichment of a few opportunistic pathogens. Many imputed metagenomic functions differed between samples from HIV-negative and HIV-positive subjects not receiving cART, possibly reflecting mucosal metabolic changes associated with HIV infection.

Food-allergic subjects had enrichment for specific microbes within the Clostridia class and Firmicutes phylum (Oscillobacter valericigenes, Lachnoclostridium bolteae, Faecalibacterium sp.) compared to siblings and controls. Identification of Clostridium sp. OTUs revealed differences in specific Clostridia drive the separation of the allergic from the siblings and controls. Alistipes sp. were enriched in non-allergic siblings. CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons in the fecal microbiome of food-allergic children, siblings, and healthy children point to key differences in microbiome signatures, suggesting the role of both genetic and environmental contributors in the manifestation of food-allergic disease.",Complete,

We have previously shown that eight weeks of walnut consumption (43 g/day) significantly improves lipids in healthy subjects. In the same study, gut microbiome was evaluated. We included 194 healthy subjects (134 females, 63 ± 7 years, BMI 25.1 ± 4.0 kg/m²) in a randomized, controlled, prospective, cross-over study. Following a nut-free run-in period, subjects were randomized to two diet phases (eight weeks each); 96 subjects first followed a walnut-enriched diet (43 g/day) and then switched to a nut-free diet, while 98 subjects followed the diets in reverse order. While consuming the walnut-enriched diet, subjects were advised to either reduce fat or carbohydrates or both to account for the additional calories. Fecal samples were collected from 135 subjects at the end of the walnut-diet and the control-diet period for microbiome analyses. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing data was clustered with a 97% similarity into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). UniFrac distances were used to determine diversity between groups. Differential abundance was evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. All analyses were performed using Rhea. Generalized UniFrac distance shows that walnut consumption significantly affects microbiome composition and diversity. Multidimensional scaling (metric and non-metric) indicates dissimilarities of approximately 5% between walnut and control (p = 0.02). The abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Bifidobacteria increased significantly (p < 0.02) while Clostridium sp. cluster XIVa species (Blautia; Anaerostipes) decreased significantly (p < 0.05) during walnut consumption. The effect of walnut consumption on the microbiome only marginally depended on whether subjects replaced fat, carbohydrates or both while on walnuts. Daily intake of 43 g walnuts over eight weeks significantly affects the gut microbiome by enhancing probiotic- and butyric acid-producing species in healthy individuals. Further evaluation is required to establish whether these changes are preserved during longer walnut consumption and how these are linked to the observed changes in lipid metabolism.",Complete,

However, the role of intestinal microbiota in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains unclear. METHODS: In a cross-sectional approach, the intestinal microbiota of 95 patients chronically infected with HCV (n=57 without cirrhosis [NO-CIR]; n=38 with cirrhosis [CIR]) and 50 healthy controls (HC) without documented liver diseases was analysed. RESULTS: Alpha diversity, measured by number of phylotypes (S) and Shannon diversity index (H'), decreased significantly from HC to NO-CIR to CIR. S and H' correlated negatively with liver elastography. Analysis of similarities revealed highly statistically significant differences in the microbial communities between HC, NO-CIR and CIR (R=.090; P<1.0×10-6 ). Stratifying for HCV genotypes even increased the differences. In addition, we observed distinct patterns in the relative abundance of genera being either positive or negative correlated with diseases status. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that not only the stage of liver disease but also HCV infection is associated with a reduced alpha diversity and different microbial community patterns. These differences might be caused by direct interactions between HCV and the microbiota or indirect interactions facilitated by the immune system.",Complete,

Colonization patterns may influence the development of atopic disease, but existing evidence is limited and conflicting. OBJECTIVE: To explore associations of infant gut microbiota and food sensitization. METHODS: Food sensitization at 1 year was determined by skin prick testing in 166 infants from the population-based Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study. Faecal samples were collected at 3 and 12 months, and microbiota was characterized by Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Twelve infants (7.2%) were sensitized to ≥ 1 common food allergen at 1 year. Enterobacteriaceae were overrepresented and Bacteroidaceae were underrepresented in the gut microbiota of food-sensitized infants at 3 months and 1 year, whereas lower microbiota richness was evident only at 3 months. Each quartile increase in richness at 3 months was associated with a 55% reduction in risk for food sensitization by 1 year (adjusted odds ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.23-0.87).

At 1 year, the Enterobacteriaceae/Bacteroidaceae ratio remained elevated among sensitized infants, who also tended to have decreased abundance of Ruminococcaceae.

Opportunistic pathogens in normal oral flora enter the bloodstream through daily oral cleaning or invasive dental procedures, leading to the occurrence of infective endocarditis. An in vitro iron-deficient condition leads to a drastic community shift in oral microbiota with increasing proportions of taxa related to infective endocarditis. To investigate the relationship among insufficient iron supply, oral microbiota and the risk of IE and to conduct a population amplification study, iron-deficiency anaemia is used as an in vivo model. METHODS: This cross-sectional study enrolled 24 primary iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) patients from 2015.6 to 2016.6 from the hematology department of West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and 24 healthy controls. High-throughput sequencing compared the dental plaque microbiota of 24 IDA (iron-deficiency anaemia) patients and 24 healthy controls. RESULTS: Sequences were classified into 12 phyla, 28 classes, 50 orders, 161 genera and 497 OTUs (the IDA and control groups shared the same 384 OTUs). Iron deficiency leads to lower internal diversity in the oral flora. The abundances of genera Corynebacterium, Neisseria, Cardiobacterium, Capnocytophaga, and Aggregatibacter were significantly higher in healthy controls, while genera Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas and Moraxella showed higher proportions in the IDA group (P < 0.05). The relative abundances of genera Lactococcus, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas and Moraxella were significantly negatively correlated with the concentration of serum ferritin (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Without an increase of oral streptococci, the main pathogen of IE, it is difficult to determine whether IDA can increase the risk of IE. However, the iron-deficient condition did lead to changes in the oral microbiota community structure. The genera that showed higher proportions in the IDA group were frequently reported as antibiotic-resistant.

As associations between microbiome composition, disease, and symptoms accumulate, the future of medicine hinges upon a comprehensive knowledge of these microorganisms for patient care. The oral microbiome may provide valuable and efficient insight for predicting future changes in disease status, infection, or treatment course. The main aim of this pilot study was to characterize the oral microbiome in patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) during their therapeutic course. SAA is a hematologic disease characterized by bone marrow failure which if untreated is fatal. Treatment includes either hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or immunosuppressive therapy (IST). In this study, we examined the oral microbiome composition of 24 patients admitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center for experimental SAA treatment. Tongue brushings were collected to assess the effects of treatment on the oral microbiome. Twenty patients received standard IST (equine antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporine) plus eltrombopag. Four patients underwent HSCT. Oral specimens were obtained at three time points during treatment and clinical follow-up. Using a novel approach to 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis encompassing seven hypervariable regions, results demonstrated a predictable decrease in microbial diversity over time among the transplant patients. Linear discriminant analysis or LefSe reported a total of 14 statistically significant taxa (p < 0.05) across time points in the HSCT patients. One-way plots of relative abundance for two bacterial species (Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Rothia mucilaginosa) in the HSCT group, show the differences in abundance between time points. Only one bacterial species (Prevotella histicola) was noted in the IST group with a p value of 0.065. The patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy did not exhibit a clear change in diversity over time; however, patient-specific changes were noted. In addition, we compared our findings to tongue dorsum samples from healthy participants in the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) database and found among HSCT patients, approximately 35% of bacterial identifiers (N = 229) were unique to this study population and were not present in tongue dorsum specimens obtained from the HMP.

Differences in bacterial composition separated the healthy and CMA populations in both the human donors and the colonized mice.

In this pilot study we sought to identify unique changes in the GMB of kidney stone patients compared to patients without KSD. With an IRB-approved protocol we enrolled 29 patients into our pilot study. 23 patients were kidney stone formers and six were non-stone forming controls. Specimens were collected after a 6h fast and were flash frozen in dry ice and then stored at -80 °C. Microbiome: determination of bacterial abundance was by analysis of 16 s rRNA marker gene sequences using next generation sequencing. Sequencing of the GMB identified 178 bacterial genera. The five most abundant enterotypes within each group made up to greater than 50 % of the bacterial abundance identified. Bacteroides was 3.4 times more abundant in the KSD group as compared to control (34.9 vs 10.2 %; p = 0.001). Prevotella was 2.8 times more abundant in the control group as compared to the KSD group (34.7 vs 12.3 %; p = 0.005).

The microbial diversity and composition, bacterial co-occurrence correlations and predictive functional profiles were compared across different microhabitats. FINDINGS: GC-specific stomach microhabitats, not GC stages or types, determine the composition and diversity of the gastric microbiota.

Helicobacter pylori (HP), Prevotella copri and Bacteroides uniformis were significantly decreased, whereas Prevotella melaninogenica, Streptococcus anginosus and Propionibacterium acnes were increased in tumoral microhabitat. Higher HP colonisation influenced the overall structure of the gastric microbiota in normal and peritumoral microhabitats.

We characterized the gut microbiome in patients from three clinical groups representing the stages of colorectal cancer development: healthy, adenoma, and carcinoma. Analysis of the gut microbiome from stool samples revealed both an enrichment and depletion of several bacterial populations associated with adenomas and carcinomas. Combined with known clinical risk factors of colorectal cancer (e.g., BMI, age, race), data from the gut microbiome significantly improved the ability to differentiate between healthy, adenoma, and carcinoma clinical groups relative to risk factors alone. Using Bayesian methods, we determined that using gut microbiome data as a screening tool improved the pretest to posttest probability of adenoma more than 50-fold. For example, the pretest probability in a 65-year-old was 0.17% and, after using the microbiome data, this increased to 10.67% (1 in 9 chance of having an adenoma).

Furthermore, allergic disease is less common among children in the formerly socialist countries of central and Eastern Europe as compared with Western Europe. It has been suggested that a reduced microbial stimulation during infancy and early childhood would result in a slower postnatal maturation of the immune system and development of an optimal balance between TH1- and TH2-like immunity. AIMS: To test the hypothesis that allergic disease among children may be associated with differences in their intestinal microflora in two countries with a low (Estonia) and a high (Sweden) prevalence of allergy. METHODS: From a prospective study of the development of allergy in relation to environmental factors, 29 Estonian and 33 Swedish 2-year-old children were selected. They were either nonallergic (n = 36) or had a confirmed diagnosis of allergy (n = 27) as verified by typical history and at least one positive skin prick test to egg or cow's milk. Weighed samples of faeces were serially diluted (10-2-10-9) and grown under anaerobic conditions. The counts of the various genera and species were calculated for each child. In addition, the relative amounts of the particular microbes were expressed as a proportion of the total count. RESULTS: The allergic children in Estonia and Sweden were less often colonized with lactobacilli (P < 0.01), as compared with the nonallergic children in the two countries. In contrast, the allergic children harboured higher counts of aerobic micro-organisms (P < 0. 05), particularly coliforms (P < 0.01) and Staphylococcus aureus (P < 0.05). The proportions of aerobic bacteria of the intestinal flora were also higher in the allergic children (P < 0.05), while the opposite was true for anaerobes (P < 0.05). Similarly, in the allergic children the proportions of coliforms were higher (P < 0. 05) and bacteroides lower (P < 0.05) than in the nonallergic children. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the indigenous intestinal flora might affect the development and priming of the immune system in early childhood, similar to what has been shown in rodents. The role of intestinal microflora in relation to the development of infant immunity and the possible consequences for allergic diseases later in life requires further study, particularly as it would be readily available for intervention as a means for primary prevention of allergy by the administration of probiotic bacteria.",Complete,

In particular, the gut microbiota may be affected by malnutrition or impaired exocrine pancreas function that is associated with pancreatic diseases. We here conducted comprehensive analysis of gut microbiota in patients with type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), a pancreatic manifestation of the systemic IgG4-related disease, and chronic pancreatitis (CP). The two diseases were selected, because altered immune reactions in AIP and/or long-standing malnutrition in CP may influence the gut microbiota. Fecal samples were obtained from 12 patients with AIP before the steroid therapy and 8 patients with CP. Metagenome DNA was extracted, and microbiota was analyzed by next generation sequencing. Gut microbiota profiles were different between patients with AIP and those with CP; namely, the proportions of Bacteroides, Streptococcus and Clostridium species were higher in patients with CP. The reasons for the increased proportion of these bacterial species remain unknown, but may reflect malabsorption and/or decreased pancreatic enzymes, both of which are associated with CP. Incidentally, the identified Streptococcus species are oral cavity inhabitants and also known as pathogens for endocarditis.

RESULTS: Bacterial microbiota in paired protected bronchial brushings (BB; n = 45), induced sputum (IS; n = 45), oral wash (OW; n = 45), and nasal brushings (NB; n = 27) from adults with mild atopic asthma (AA), atopy without asthma (ANA), and healthy controls (HC) were profiled using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Though microbiota composition varied with sample type (p < 0.001), compositional similarity was greatest for BB-IS, particularly in AAs and ANAs. The abundance of genera detected in BB correlated with those detected in IS and OW (r median [IQR] 0.869 [0.748-0.942] and 0.822 [0.687-0.909] respectively), but not with those in NB (r = 0.004 [- 0.003-0.011]).

OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare the bronchial bacterial microbiota in adults with steroid-naive atopic asthma, subjects with atopy but no asthma, and nonatopic healthy control subjects and to determine relationships of the bronchial microbiota to phenotypic features of asthma. METHODS: Bacterial communities in protected bronchial brushings from 42 atopic asthmatic subjects, 21 subjects with atopy but no asthma, and 21 healthy control subjects were profiled by using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacterial composition and community-level functions inferred from sequence profiles were analyzed for between-group differences. Associations with clinical and inflammatory variables were examined, including markers of type 2-related inflammation and change in airway hyperresponsiveness after 6 weeks of fluticasone treatment. RESULTS: The bronchial microbiome differed significantly among the 3 groups. Asthmatic subjects were uniquely enriched in members of the Haemophilus, Neisseria, Fusobacterium, and Porphyromonas species and the Sphingomonodaceae family and depleted in members of the Mogibacteriaceae family and Lactobacillales order. Asthma-associated differences in predicted bacterial functions included involvement of amino acid and short-chain fatty acid metabolism pathways. Subjects with type 2-high asthma harbored significantly lower bronchial bacterial burden. Distinct changes in specific microbiota members were seen after fluticasone treatment. Steroid responsiveness was linked to differences in baseline compositional and functional features of the bacterial microbiome. CONCLUSION: Even in subjects with mild steroid-naive asthma, differences in the bronchial microbiome are associated with immunologic and clinical features of the disease. The specific differences identified suggest possible microbiome targets for future approaches to asthma treatment or prevention.",Complete,

Whether the perturbed microbiota community is restored after disease remission and cessation of cancer treatment has not been evaluated. This study examines the chronological changes of gut microbiota in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) prior to the start-, during-, and following cessation of chemotherapy. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a longitudinal observational study in gut microbiota profile in a group of paediatric patients diagnosed with ALL using 16 s ribosomal RNA sequencing and compared these patients' microbiota pattern with age and ethnicity-matched healthy children. Temporal changes of gut microbiota in these patients with ALL were also examined at different time-points in relation to chemotherapy. RESULTS: Prior to commencement of chemotherapy, gut microbiota in children with ALL had larger inter-individual variability compared to healthy controls and was enriched with bacteria belonging to Bacteroidetes phylum and Bacteroides genus. The relative abundance of Bacteroides decreased upon commencement of chemotherapy. Restitution of gut microbiota composition to resemble that of healthy controls occurred after cessation of chemotherapy. However, the microbiota composition (beta diversity) remained distinctive and a few bacteria were different in abundance among the patients with ALL compared to controls despite completion of chemotherapy and presumed restoration of normal health. CONCLUSION: Our findings in this pilot study is the first to suggest that gut microbiota profile in children with ALL remains marginally different from healthy controls even after cessation of chemotherapy.

A more detailed understanding of interactions between S. pneumoniae and the nasopharyngeal microbiota of children could inform strategies to prevent pneumococcal infections. METHODS: We collected nasopharyngeal swabs from children 1 to 23 months of age in Botswana between August 2012 and June 2016. We tested samples for S. pneumoniae and common respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction. We sequenced the V3 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene and used random forest models to identify clinical variables and bacterial genera that were associated with pneumococcal colonization. RESULTS: Mean age of the 170 children included in this study was 8.3 months. Ninety-six (56%) children were colonized with S. pneumoniae. Pneumococcal colonization was associated with older age (P = 0.0001), a lack of electricity in the home (P = 0.02) and household use of wood as a cooking fuel (P = 0.002). Upper respiratory symptoms were more frequent in children with S. pneumoniae colonization (60% vs. 32%; P = 0.001). Adjusting for age, nasopharyngeal microbiota composition differed in colonized and noncolonized children (P = 0.001). S. pneumoniae colonization was associated with a higher relative abundance of Moraxella (P = 0.001) and lower relative abundances of Corynebacterium (P = 0.001) and Staphylococcus (P = 0.03).

All children and adolescent acute leukemia patients will undergo chemotherapy as part of their treatment regimen. Fortunately, survival rates for most pediatric cancers have improved at a remarkable pace over the past three decades, and the overall survival rate is greater than 90 % today. However, significant differences in survival rate have been found in different age groups (94 % in 1-9.99 years, 82 % in ≥10 years and 76 % in ≥15 years). ALL accounts for about three out of four cases of childhood leukemia. Intensive chemotherapy treatment coupled with prophylactic or therapeutic antibiotic use could potentially have a long-term effect on the resident gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome. The composition of GI microbiome and its changes upon chemotherapy in pediatric and adolescent leukemia patients is poorly understood. In this study, using 16S rRNA marker gene sequences we profile the GI microbial communities of pediatric and adolescent acute leukemia patients before and after chemotherapy treatment and compare with the microbiota of their healthy siblings. RESULTS: Our study cohort consisted of 51 participants, made up of matched pediatric and adolescent patients with ALL and a healthy sibling. We elucidated and compared the GI microbiota profiles of patients and their healthy sibling controls via analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. We assessed the GI microbiota composition in pediatric and adolescent patients with ALL during the course of chemotherapy by comparing stool samples taken before chemotherapy with stool samples collected at varying time points during the chemotherapeutic treatment. The microbiota profiles of both patients and control sibling groups are dominated by members of Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Faecalibacterium. At the genus level, both groups share many taxa in common, but the microbiota diversity of the patient group is significantly lower than that of the control group. It was possible to distinguish between the patient and control groups based on their microbiota profiles. The top taxa include Anaerostipes, Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Ruminococcus2 with relatively higher abundance in the control group. The observed microbiota changes are likely the result of several factors including a direct influence of therapeutic compounds on the gut flora and an indirect effect of chemotherapy on the immune system, which, in turn, affects the microbiota.

METHOD: Self-collected mid-vaginal swabs were profiled for bacterial composition by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metabolites by both gas and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, and 37 types of HPV DNA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Metabolite abundances. RESULTS: Vaginal microbiota clustered into Community State Type (CST) I (Lactobacillus crispatus-dominated), CST III (Lactobacillus iners-dominated), and CST IV (low-Lactobacillus, 'molecular-BV'). HPV+ women had higher biogenic amine and phospholipid concentrations compared with HPV- women after adjustment for CST and cigarette smoking. Metabolomic profiles of HPV+ and HPV- women differed in strata of CST. In CST III, there were higher concentrations of biogenic amines and glycogen-related metabolites in HPV+ women than in HPV- women. In CST IV, there were lower concentrations of glutathione, glycogen, and phospholipid-related metabolites in HPV+ participants than in HPV- participants. Across all CSTs, women with hrHPV strains had lower concentrations of amino acids, lipids, and peptides compared with women who had only low-risk HPV (lrHPV). CONCLUSIONS: The vaginal metabolome of HPV+ women differed from HPV- women in terms of several metabolites, including biogenic amines, glutathione, and lipid-related metabolites. If the temporal relation between increased levels of reduced glutathione and oxidised glutathione and HPV incidence/persistence is confirmed in future studies, anti-oxidant therapies may be considered as a non-surgical HPV control intervention.

Microbial community profiles were compared between early onset pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) and control children similar for age and sex. METHODS: Children ≤18 years old within 2 years of MS onset or controls without autoimmune disorders attending a University of California, San Francisco, USA, pediatric clinic were examined for fecal bacterial community composition and predicted function by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and phylogenetic reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt) analysis. Associations between subject characteristics and the microbiota, including beta diversity and taxa abundance, were identified using non-parametric tests, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and negative binomial regression. RESULTS: Eighteen relapsing-remitting MS cases and 17 controls (mean age 13 years; range 4-18) were studied. Cases had a short disease duration (mean 11 months; range 2-24) and half were immunomodulatory drug (IMD) naïve. Whilst overall gut bacterial beta diversity was not significantly related to MS status, IMD exposure was (Canberra, P < 0.02). However, relative to controls, MS cases had a significant enrichment in relative abundance for members of the Desulfovibrionaceae (Bilophila, Desulfovibrio and Christensenellaceae) and depletion in Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae (all P and q < 0.000005). Microbial genes predicted as enriched in MS versus controls included those involved in glutathione metabolism (Mann-Whitney, P = 0.017), findings that were consistent regardless of IMD exposure. CONCLUSIONS: In recent onset pediatric MS, perturbations in the gut microbiome composition were observed, in parallel with predicted enrichment of metabolic pathways associated with neurodegeneration.

However, only a small percentage of high-risk (HR) HPV infections progress to cervical precancer and cancer. In this study, we investigated the role of the cervicovaginal microbiome (CVM) in the natural history of HR-HPV. METHODS: This study was nested within the placebo arm of the Costa Rica HPV Vaccine Trial that included women aged 18-25 years of age. Cervical samples from two visits of women with an incident HR-HPV infection (n = 273 women) were used to evaluate the prospective role of the CVM on the natural history of HR-HPV. We focus specifically on infection clearance, persistence, and progression to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and 3 (CIN2+). The CVM was characterized by amplification and sequencing the bacterial 16S V4 rRNA gene region and the fungal ITS1 region using an Illumina MiSeq platform. OTU clustering was performed using QIIME2. Functional groups were imputed using PICRUSt and statistical analyses were performed using R. RESULTS: At Visit 1 (V1) abundance of Lactobacillus iners was associated with clearance of incident HR-HPV infections (Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)>4.0), whereas V1 Gardnerella was the dominant biomarker for HR-HPV progression (LDA>4.0). At visit 2 (V2), increased microbial Shannon diversity was significantly associated with progression to CIN2+ (p = 0.027). Multivariate mediation analysis revealed that the positive association of V1 Gardnerella with CIN2+ progression was due to the increased cervicovaginal diversity at V2 (p = 0.040). A full multivariate model of key components of the CVM showed significant protective effects via V1 genus Lactobacillus, OR = 0.41 (0.22-0.79), V1 fungal diversity, OR = 0.90 (0.82-1.00) and V1 functional Cell Motility pathway, OR = 0.75 (0.62-0.92), whereas V2 bacterial diversity, OR = 1.19 (1.03-1.38) was shown to be predictive of progression to CIN2+. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that features of the cervicovaginal microbiome are associated with HR-HPV progression in a prospective longitudinal cohort. The analyses indicated that the association of Gardnerella and progression to CIN2+ may actually be mediated by subsequent elevation of microbial diversity. Identified features of the microbiome associated with HR-HPV progression may be targets for therapeutic manipulation to prevent CIN2+.

Being the diet a key factor modulating gut microbiota composition, the aim of the present paper was to compare dietary intakes, gut microbiota biodiversity and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production in children with PKU, on low-Phe diet, and in children with mild hyperphenylalaninemia (MHP), on unrestricted diet. METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 21 PKU and 21 MHP children matched for gender, age and body mass index z-score. Dietary intakes, including glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL), and fecal microbiota analyses, by means of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and Real-time PCR were assessed. Fecal SCFAs were quantified by gas chromatographic analysis. RESULTS: We observed an increased carbohydrate (% of total energy), fiber and vegetables intakes (g/day) in PKU compared with MHP children (p = 0.047), as well a higher daily GI and GL (maximum p < 0.001). Compared with MHP, PKU showed a lower degree of microbial diversity and a decrease in fecal butyrate content (p = 0.02). Accordingly, two of the most abundant butyrate-producing genera, Faecalibacterium spp. and Roseburia spp., were found significantly depleted in PKU children (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSION: The low-Phe diet, characterized by a higher carbohydrate intake, increases GI and GL, resulting in a different quality of substrates for microbial fermentation.

The bacterial 16S rRNA gene was analyzed by high-depth sequencing to determine the diversity and composition of the microbiome. Results: After the induction and reinduction I phases of chemotherapy, microbial diversity decreased significantly relative to the prechemotherapy value. After chemotherapy, the relative abundance of certain bacterial taxa (eg, Bacteroidetes) decreased significantly, whereas that of other taxa (eg, Clostridiaceae and Streptococcaceae) increased. A baseline gut microbiome characterized by Proteobacteria predicted febrile neutropenia. Adjusting for the chemotherapy phase and ALL risk level, Enterococcaceae dominance (relative abundance ≥30%) predicted significantly greater risk of subsequent febrile neutropenia and diarrheal illness, whereas Streptococcaceae dominance predicted significantly greater risk of subsequent diarrheal illness. Conclusions: In children undergoing therapy for newly diagnosed ALL, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria before chemotherapy initiation predicts development of febrile neutropenia, and domination of the gut microbiota by Enterococcaceae or Streptococcaceae at any time during chemotherapy predicts infection in subsequent phases of chemotherapy.

Although great efforts have been made to understand the risk factors for multiple myeloma (MM), little is known about the role of the gut microbiome and alterations of its metabolic functions in the development of MM. RESULTS: Here, in a cohort of newly diagnosed patients with MM and healthy controls (HCs), significant differences in metagenomic composition were discovered, for the first time, with higher bacterial diversity in MM. Specifically, nitrogen-recycling bacteria such as Klebsiella and Streptococcus were significantly enriched in MM. Also, the bacteria enriched in MM were significantly correlated with the host metabolome, suggesting strong metabolic interactions between microbes and the host. In addition, the MM-enriched bacteria likely result from the regulation of urea nitrogen accumulated during MM progression. Furthermore, by performing fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) into 5TGM1 mice, we proposed a mechanistic explanation for the interaction between MM-enriched bacteria and MM progression via recycling urea nitrogen. Further experiments validated that Klebsiella pneumoniae promoted MM progression via de novo synthesis of glutamine in mice and that the mice fed with glutamine-deficient diet exhibited slower MM progression.

However, the vast majority of data regarding microbiome stability are derived from healthy subjects. Herein, we sought to determine intra-patient temporal microbiota variability, the factors driving such variability, and its clinical impact in an extensive longitudinal cohort of hospitalized cancer patients during chemotherapy. METHODS: The stool (n = 365) and oral (n = 483) samples of 59 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing induction chemotherapy (IC) were sampled from initiation of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery. Microbiome characterization was performed via analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Temporal variability was determined using coefficients of variation (CV) of the Shannon diversity index (SDI) and unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances per patient, per site. Measurements of intra-patient temporal variability and patient stability categories were analyzed for their correlations with genera abundances. Groups of patients were analyzed to determine if patients with adverse outcomes had significantly different levels of microbiome temporal variability. Potential clinical drivers of microbiome temporal instability were determined using multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: Our cohort evidenced a high degree of intra-patient temporal instability of stool and oral microbial diversity based on SDI CV. We identified statistically significant differences in the relative abundance of multiple taxa amongst individuals with different levels of microbiota temporal stability. Increased intra-patient temporal variability of the oral SDI was correlated with increased risk of infection during IC (P = 0.02), and higher stool SDI CVs were correlated with increased risk of infection 90 days post-IC (P = 0.04). Total days on antibiotics was significantly associated with increased temporal variability of both oral microbial diversity (P = 0.03) and community structure (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These data quantify the longitudinal variability of the oral and gut microbiota in AML patients, show that increased variability was correlated with adverse clinical outcomes, and offer the possibility of using stabilizing taxa as a method of focused microbiome repletion.

AIM: To identify functional mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiome may play a key role in the pathophysiology of GI mucositis, we applied high-throughput DNA-sequencing analysis to identify microbes and microbial functions that are modulated following chemotherapy. METHODS: We amplified and sequenced 16S rRNA genes from faecal samples before and after chemotherapy in 28 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who received the same myeloablative conditioning regimen and no other concomitant therapy such as antibiotics.

Resident commensal bacteria are a fundamental line of resistance to colonization by exogenous microbes. They actively regulate the production of nutrients by the host through a negative feedback mechanism, in order to prevent the availability of nutrients for potential pathogens. While only a small fraction of these microorganism may be pathogenic, the relationship between host and commensal microbiome is now studied as a whole, impacting several aspects of the host biology. Some studies have made clear the progresses in examining the role of microbiome on transplants and graft versus host disease (GVHD) severity and its pathogenesis: the risk of complications from allogenic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (HSCT) is greater with the highest mortality if a patient has a lower bacterial diversity in the gut prior to the transplantation process beginning. Microbiota-associated molecular patterns are directly recognized by pathogen recognition receptors. The development of molecular methods has greatly expanded our knowledge of the composition and function of the microbiome in health and disease, shortening the response times vs. microbiological culture tests. The gut flora can make the difference when it comes to allo-HSCT. The aim of the study was to monitor microbiome of 10 children during allo-HSCT. METHODS: Oral specimens and gut faecal microbiome (100 grams) samples were collected at 2, 16, 24 days. The samples were analysed by polymerase chain reaction and primary sequencing was done. To calculate the biodiversity of microbiome the Shannon index and the Observed species index were chosen. RESULTS: Our study suggests some differences in the diversity indices (DIs) in 5 children affected by GVHD vs. not affected. The DIs in oral and faecal specimens show in all patients a diminution in the post-transplant phase with an improvement in species diversity after 16 days from the transplant. The Observed species index in faeces specimens after 16 days was higher in patients which had not GVHD; moreover, patients with GVHD showed a deterioration at 24 days. Oral specimens after 24 days showed a parallel trend in the two groups. The Shannon index shows a downward trend in faeces specimens of the children with GVHD at 24 days; the children without GVHD recover a good trend of entropy. Oral specimens at 24 days show low entropy in the two groups. Very aggressive bacterial species as Cronobacter and Routella in the faeces specimens of a child had not serious consequences for disease status: Cronobacter were not present 24 days after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: The data show the microbial metabolome could have an impact on patients with GVHD vs. no GVHD. A better understanding of the role of the oral and gut microbiome in GVHD can give directions to move towards the development of innovative approaches for preventing GVHD following allo-HCT, reducing also antibiotic therapy.",Complete,

RESULTS: Immaturity affects the microbiota as indicated by a reduced percentage of the family Bacteroidaceae during the first months of life and by a higher initial percentage of Lactobacillaceae in preterm infants compared with full term infants. Perinatal antibiotics, including intrapartum antimicrobial prophylaxis, affects the gut microbiota, as indicated by increased Enterobacteriaceae family organisms in the infants. CONCLUSIONS: Prematurity and perinatal antibiotic administration strongly affect the initial establishment of microbiota with potential consequences for later health.",Complete,

Prenatal antibiotics have been associated with later obesity in children, which is thought to be driven by microbiome dependent mechanisms. However, there is little data regarding associations of prenatal or peripartum antibiotic exposure, with or without cesarean section (CS), with the features of the meconium microbiome. In this study, 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on bacterial DNA of meconium samples from 105 infants in a birth cohort study. After multivariable adjustment, delivery mode (p = 0.044), prenatal antibiotic use (p = 0.005) and peripartum antibiotic use (p < 0.001) were associated with beta diversity of the infant meconium microbiome. CS (vs. vaginal delivery) and peripartum antibiotics were also associated with greater alpha diversity of the meconium microbiome (Shannon and Simpson, p < 0.05). Meconium from infants born by CS (vs. vaginal delivery) had lower relative abundance of the genus Escherichia (p < 0.001). Prenatal antibiotic use and peripartum antibiotic use (both in the overall analytic sample and when restricting to vaginally delivered infants) were associated with differential abundance of several bacterial taxa in the meconium. Bacterial taxa in the meconium microbiome were also differentially associated with infant excess weight at 12 months of age, however, sample size was limited for this comparison. In conclusion, prenatal and peripartum antibiotic use along with CS delivery were associated with differences in the diversity and composition of the meconium microbiome.

The gut microbiota is an emerging crucial player in the homeostatic regulation of glucose metabolism. Few studies have investigated its role in the PM2.5 exposure-induced abnormalities in glucose homeostasis. METHODS: C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to filtered air (FA) or concentrated ambient PM2.5 (CAP) for 12 months using a versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system (VACES) that was modified for long-term whole-body exposures. Their glucose homeostasis and gut microbiota were examined and analysed by correlation and mediation analysis. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that CAP exposure markedly impaired their glucose and insulin tolerance. Faecal microbiota analysis demonstrated that the impairment in glucose homeostasis was coincided with decreased faecal bacterial ACE and Chao-1 estimators (the indexes of community richness), while there was no significant change in all faecal fungal alpha diversity estimators. The Pearson's correlation analyses showed that the bacterial richness estimators were correlated with glucose and insulin tolerance, and the mediation analyses displayed a significant mediation of CAP exposure-induced glucose intolerance by the alteration in the bacterial Chao-1 estimator. LEfSe analyses revealed 24 bacterial and 21 fungal taxa differential between CAP- and FA-exposed animals. Of these, 14 and 20 bacterial taxa were correlated with IPGTT AUC and ITT AUC, respectively, and 5 fungal taxa were correlated with abnormalities in glucose metabolism.

Samples were further assessed for the presence and levels of fecal and serum secretory IgA (sIgA), proinflammatory proteins, and fatty acids. RESULTS: The gut microbiota observed in patients with PsA and patients with skin psoriasis was less diverse when compared to that in healthy controls. This could be attributed to the reduced presence of several taxa. Samples from both patient groups showed a relative decrease in abundance of Coprococcus species, while samples from PsA patients were also characterized by a significant reduction in Akkermansia, Ruminococcus, and Pseudobutyrivibrio. Supernatants of fecal samples from PsA patients revealed an increase in sIgA levels and decrease in RANKL levels.

METHODS: Among 28 preterm infants, there were two groups, the PAT (prenatal antibiotic therapy) group (12 cases), and the PAF (prenatal antibiotic free) group (12 cases). Fecal samples from both groups were collected on days 7 and 14. According to the time of prenatal and postnatal antibiotic exposure, cases were divided into two groups, H (high) group (11 cases) and L (low) group (11 cases), and fecal samples on day 14 were collected. Genomic DNA was extracted from the fecal samples and was subjected to high throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Bioinformatics methods were used to analyze the sequencing results. RESULTS: Prenatal and postnatal antibiotic exposure exercised influence on the early establishment of intestinal microflora of preterm infants. Bacteroidetes decreased significantly in the PAT group (p < 0.05). The number of Bifidobacterium significantly decreased in the PAT group and H group (p < 0.05). The early gut microbiota of preterm infants with prenatal and postnatal antibiotic exposure was similar to resistant bacteria in NICU during the same period.

METHODS: Wild-type 129/SvEv mice were gavaged with Ottawa urban PM10 (EHC-93) for 7-14 days and mucosal gene expression analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways software. Intestinal permeability was measured by lactulose/mannitol excretion in urine. At sacrifice, segments of small and large intestine were cultured and cytokine secretion measured. Splenocytes were isolated and incubated with PM10 for measurement of proliferation. Long-term effects of exposure (35 days) on intestinal cytokine expression were measured in wild-type and IL-10 deficient (IL-10(-/-)) mice. Microbial composition of stool samples was assessed using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism. Short chain fatty acids were measured in caecum. RESULTS: Short-term treatment of wild-type mice with PM10 altered immune gene expression, enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in the small intestine, increased gut permeability, and induced hyporesponsiveness in splenocytes. Long-term treatment of wild-type and IL-10(-/-) mice increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the colon and altered short chain fatty acid concentrations and microbial composition.

Gut microbiota dysbiosis might have significant effect on the development of obesity. The microbiota continues to develop through childhood and thus childhood may be the prime time for microbiota interventions to realize health promotion or disease prevention. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the structure and function of pediatric gut microbiota. Methods: According to the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria, twenty-three normal weight and twenty-eight obese children were recruited from Nanjing, China. Genomic DNA was extracted from fecal samples. The V4 region of the bacterial 16S rDNA was amplified by PCR, and sequencing was applied to analyze the gut microbiota diversity and composition using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Results: The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed a decrease in the diversity of gut microbiota with increasing body weight. The alpha diversity indices showed that the normal weight group had higher abundance and observed species than the obese group (Chao1: P < 0.001; observed species: P < 0.001; PD whole tree: P < 0.001; Shannon index: P = 0.008). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed significant differences in gut microbial community structure between the normal weight group and the obese group. The liner discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis showed that fifty-five species of bacteria were abundant in the fecal samples of the normal weight group and forty-five species of bacteria were abundant in the obese group. In regard to phyla, the gut microbiota in the obese group had lower proportions of Bacteroidetes (51.35%) compared to the normal weight group (55.48%) (P = 0.030). There was no statistical difference in Firmicutes between the two groups (P = 0.436), and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes between the two groups had no statistical difference (P = 0.983). At the genus level, Faecalibacterium, Phascolarctobacterium, Lachnospira, Megamonas, and Haemophilus were significantly more abundant in the obese group than in the normal weight group (P = 0.048, P = 0.018, P < 0.001, P = 0.040, and P = 0.003, respectively). The fecal microbiota of children in the obese group had lower proportions of Oscillospira and Dialister compared to the normal weight group (P = 0.002 and P = 0.002, respectively).

Smoking has the potential to alter the microbiota; however, to date, the impact of smoking on the mucosa-associated microbiota (MAM), and particularly that of the upper GI tract, remains very poorly characterised. Thus, we investigated the impact of smoking on the upper small intestinal MAM. A total of 102 patients undergoing upper GI endoscopy for the assessment of GI symptoms, iron deficiency, or Crohn's disease, but without identifiable lesions in the duodenum, were recruited. Smoking status was determined during clinical assessment and patients classified as current (n = 21), previous smokers (n = 40), or having never smoked (n = 41). The duodenal (D2) MAM was profiled via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. RESULTS: Smoking, both current and previous, is associated with significantly reduced bacterial diversity in the upper small intestinal mucosa, as compared to patients who had never smoked. This was accompanied by higher relative abundance of Firmicutes, specifically Streptococcus and Veillonella spp. The relative abundance of the genus Rothia was also observed to be greater in current smokers; while in contrast, levels of Prevotella and Neisseria were lower. The MAM profiles and diversity of previous smokers were observed to be intermediate between current and never smokers. Smoking did not impact the total density of bacteria present on the mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate the duodenal MAM of current smokers is characterised by reduced bacterial diversity, which is partially but not completely restored in previous smokers. While the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated, these microbiota changes may in some part explain the adverse effects of smoking on mucosa-associated diseases of the GI tract.

Statistical analyses with exacerbation as the primary outcome and rhinovirus infection and respiratory illnesses as secondary outcomes were performed. Using A549 epithelial cells, we assessed nasal isolates of Moraxella, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium species for their capacity to induce epithelial damage and inflammatory responses. RESULTS: Six nasal airway microbiota assemblages, each dominated by Moraxella, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Streptococcus, Alloiococcus, or Haemophilus species, were observed. Moraxella and Staphylococcus species-dominated microbiotas were most frequently detected and exhibited temporal stability. Nasal microbiotas dominated by Moraxella species were associated with increased exacerbation risk and eosinophil activation. Staphylococcus or Corynebacterium species-dominated microbiotas were associated with reduced respiratory illness and exacerbation events, whereas Streptococcus species-dominated assemblages increased the risk of rhinovirus infection. Nasal microbiota composition remained relatively stable despite viral infection or exacerbation; only a few taxa belonging to the dominant genera exhibited relative abundance fluctuations during these events. In vitro, Moraxella catarrhalis induced significantly greater epithelial damage and inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-33 and IL-8) compared with other dominant nasal bacterial isolates tested.

The excreted/secreted proteins (secretome) of the gut microbiota affect the microbial composition, altering its colonization and persistence. Furthermore, it influences microbiota-host interactions by triggering inflammatory reactions and modulating the host's immune response. The metatranscriptome is essential to elucidate which genes are expressed under diseases. In this regard, little is known about the expressed secretome in the microbiome. Here, we use a metatranscriptomic approach to delineate the secretome of the gut microbiome of Mexican children with normal weight (NW) obesity (O) and obesity with metabolic syndrome (OMS). Additionally, we performed the 16S rRNA profiling of the gut microbiota. RESULTS: Out of the 115,712 metatranscriptome genes that codified for proteins, 30,024 (26%) were predicted to be secreted, constituting the Secrebiome of the gut microbiome. The 16S profiling confirmed an increased abundance in Firmicutes and decreased in Bacteroidetes in the obesity groups, and a significantly higher richness and diversity than the normal weight group. We found novel biomarkers for obesity with metabolic syndrome such as increased Coriobacteraceae, Collinsela, and Collinsella aerofaciens; Erysipelotrichaceae, Catenibacterium and Catenibacterium sp., and decreased Parabacteroides distasonis, which correlated with clinical and anthropometric parameters associated to obesity and metabolic syndrome. Related to the Secrebiome, 16 genes, homologous to F. prausniitzi, were overexpressed for the obese and 15 genes homologous to Bacteroides, were overexpressed in the obesity with metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, a significant enrichment of CAZy enzymes was found in the Secrebiome. Additionally, significant differences in the antigenic density of the Secrebiome were found between normal weight and obesity groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show, for the first time, the role of the Secrebiome in the functional human-microbiota interaction. Our results highlight the importance of metatranscriptomics to provide novel information about the gut microbiome's functions that could help us understand the impact of the Secrebiome on the homeostasis of its human host. Furthermore, the metatranscriptome and 16S profiling confirmed the importance of treating obesity and obesity with metabolic syndrome as separate conditions to better understand the interplay between microbiome and disease.",Complete,

As such, our objective was to characterize the composition of the gut microbiota in children with obesity/overweight and children of normal weight to determine if there are any gut microbes associated with overweight and obesity. Methods: Fifty-one children provided stool samples and their BMIs were calculated and classified. 16S amplicons from stool samples were individually barcoded and sequenced in multiplex in the NextSeq 500 platform in a 150 bp paired-end modality and a complete gut microbiome profile was generated. Results: The relative abundance and diversity of the microbiota of the lean and children with obesity/overweight were analyzed against each other and showed that children with obesity/overweight recorded significantly more (p = 0.001) Firmicutes and significantly less Bifidobacterium (p = 0.039) than the children of normal weight.

One member of phylum Firmicutes was under-represented significantly in the fecal microbiome of NAFLD patients (Ruminococcaceae; genus, Oscillibacter). Fecal VOC profiles of the 2 patient groups were different, with a significant increase in fecal ester compounds observed in NAFLD patients. CONCLUSIONS: A significant increase in fecal ester VOC is associated with compositional shifts in the microbiome of obese NAFLD patients. These novel bacterial metabolomic and metagenomic factors are implicated in the etiology and complications of obesity.",Complete,

This preliminary cross-sectional study sought to assess the effect of using shammah, a form of smokeless tobacco prevalent in Arabia, on the tongue microbiome. Tongue scarping samples were obtained from 29 shammah users (SU; 27.34 ± 6.9 years) and 23 shammah non-users (SNU; 27.7 ± 7.19 years) and analyzed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V1-V3). Species-level taxonomy assignment of the high-quality, merged reads was obtained using a previously described BLASTn-based algorithm. Downstream analyses were performed with QIIME, LEfSe, and R. RESULTS: A total of 178 species, belonging to 62 genera and 8 phyla were identified. Genera Streptococcus, Leptotrichia, Actinomyces, Veillonella, Haemophilus, Prevotella and Neisseria accounted for more than 60% of the average microbiome. There were no differences between the two groups in species richness and alpha-diversity, but PCoA showed significant separation (P = 0.015, ANOSIM). LEfSe analysis identified 22 species to be differentially abundant between the SU and SNU. However, only 7 species maintained a false discovery rate of ≤0.2 and could cluster the two groups separately: Rothia mucilaginosa, Streptococcus sp. oral taxon 66, Actinomyces meyeri, Streptococcus vestibularis Streptococcus sanguinis and a potentially novel Veillonella species in association with SU, and Oribacterium asaccharolyticum with SNU.

We found a seasonally persistent association between the detected blood concentration of the insecticide azinphos-methyl and the taxonomic composition of the buccal swab oral microbiome. Blood and buccal samples were collected concurrently from individual subjects in two seasons, spring/summer 2005 and winter 2006. Mass spectrometry quantified blood concentrations of the organophosphate insecticide azinphos-methyl. Buccal oral microbiome samples were 16S rRNA gene DNA sequenced, assigned to the bacterial taxonomy, and analyzed after ""centered-log-ratio"" transformation to handle the compositional nature of the proportional abundances of bacteria per sample. Nonparametric analysis of the transformed microbiome data for individuals with and without azinphos-methyl blood detection showed significant perturbations in seven common bacterial taxa (>0.5% of sample mean read depth), including significant reductions in members of the common oral bacterial genus Streptococcus Diversity in centered-log-ratio composition between individuals' microbiomes was also investigated using principal-component analysis (PCA) to reveal two primary PCA clusters of microbiome types.

The five tested substrates were raffinose, melibiose, a mixture of oligo- and polysaccharides produced from raffinose by levansucrase, levan synthesized from raffinose, and levan from timothy grass. Two inocula were comprised of pooled fecal samples from overweight or normal-weight children, from healthy adult volunteers and a pure culture of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron as a reference bacterium for colon microbiota. The growth was analyzed based on the heat evolution curves, and the production of organic acids and gases. Taxonomic profiles of the microbiota were assessed by 16S rDNA sequencing. Raffinose and melibiose promoted the growth of bifidobacteria in all fecal pools. Several pool-specific substrate-related responses to raffinose and melibiose were revealed. Lactate-producing bacteria (Streptococcus and Enterococcus) became enriched in the pool of overweight children resulting in lactic acid as the major fermentation product on short saccharides. Acetic and butyric acids were prevalent at fermentation in the normal-weight pool coinciding with the enrichment of Catenibacterium. In the adult pool, the specific promotion of Bacteroides and Lachnospiraceae by levans was disclosed. In the fecal pool of normal-weight children, levans stimulated the growth of Senegalimassilia and Lachnoclostridium and this particular pool also showed the highest maximum heat production rate at levan fermentation. Levans and raffinose-derived oligosaccharides, but not raffinose and melibiose were completely fermented by a pure culture of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.

Microbiota composition was determined using 16S ribosomal RNA V4 sequencing. Fecal indole and butyrate levels were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Among HSCT recipients, both fecal indole and butyrate levels correlated with the Shannon diversity index at baseline (P = .02 and P = .002, respectively) and directly after transplantation (P = .006 and P < .001, respectively). Samples with high butyrate levels were enriched for Clostridiales, whereas samples containing high indole were also enriched for Bacteroidales.

METHODS: Intestinal microbiome samples were collected at age 3-6 months in children participating in the follow-up phase of an interventional trial of high-dose vitamin D given during pregnancy. At age 3, sensitization to foods (milk, egg, peanut, soy, wheat, walnut) was assessed. Food allergy was defined as caretaker report of healthcare provider-diagnosed allergy to the above foods prior to age 3 with evidence of IgE sensitization. Analysis was performed using Phyloseq and DESeq2; P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Complete data were available for 225 children; there were 87 cases of food sensitization and 14 cases of food allergy. Microbial diversity measures did not differ between food sensitization and food allergy cases and controls. The genera Haemophilus (log2 fold change -2.15, P=.003), Dialister (log2 fold change -2.22, P=.009), Dorea (log2 fold change -1.65, P=.02), and Clostridium (log2 fold change -1.47, P=.002) were underrepresented among subjects with food sensitization.

METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Stool samples were obtained from 20 patients with NMOSD and 20 healthy family members of the patients as controls (HC). The bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplification sequencing (V3-V4 region) was used to detect the composition and structure of the intestinal microbiota community in the two groups. RESULTS: The gut microbiota compositions clearly differed between the NMOSD and HC groups, although there was no significant difference in the overall microbial community structure. In detail, patients with NMOSD had an increased abundance of the pathogenic genera Flavonifractor (P = .004) and Streptococcus (P = .007) compared with the HC. In addition, several intestinal commensal bacteria were detected at significantly lower abundance in the NMOSD patients compared to the controls, including Faecalibacterium, Lachnospiracea_incertae_sedis, Prevotella, Blautia, Roseburia, Romboutsia, Coprococcus, and Fusicatenibacter (all P < .05).

METHODS: Eighty-five children with rhinitis (n = 27) and with asthma (n = 34) and healthy controls (n = 24) were enrolled. Fecal metabolomic analysis with 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and microbiome composition analysis by bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing were performed. An integrative analysis of their associations with allergen-specific IgE levels for allergic rhinitis and asthma was also assessed. RESULTS: Amino acid, β-alanine, and butanoate were the predominant metabolic pathways in the gut. Among them, amino acid metabolism was negatively correlated with the phylum Firmicutes, which was significantly reduced in children with rhinitis and asthma. Levels of histidine and butyrate metabolites were significantly reduced in children with rhinitis (P = 0.029) and asthma (P = 0.009), respectively. In children with asthma, a reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria, including Faecalibacterium and Roseburia spp., and an increase in Clostridium spp. were negatively correlated with fecal amino acids and butyrate, respectively (P < 0.01). Increased Escherichia spp. accompanied by increased β-alanine and 4-hydroxybutyrate appeared to reduce butyrate production. Low fecal butyrate was significantly associated with increased total serum and mite allergen-specific IgE levels in children with asthma (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: A reduced fecal butyrate is associated with increased mite-specific IgE levels and the risk of asthma in early childhood.

METHODS: Microbial composition and diversity were analysed with barcoded 16S rRNA 454 pyrosequencing in stool samples in pregnancy and at ages 1 week, 1 month and 12 months in infants (n = 10) who developed IgE-associated eczema and infants who remained free of any allergic symptoms at 2.5 years of age (n = 10). Microbiome data at 1 week and 1 month were analysed in relation to previously assessed immune responses to TLR 2 and 4 ligands at 6 months of age. RESULTS: The relative abundance of Gram-positive Ruminococcaceae was lower at 1 week of age in infants developing IgE-associated eczema, compared with controls (P = 0.0047). At that age, the relative abundance of Ruminococcus was inversely associated with TLR2 induced IL-6 (-0.567, P = 0.042) and TNF-α (-0.597, P = 0.032); there was also an inverse association between the abundance of Proteobacteria (comprising Gram-negative taxa) and TLR4-induced TNF-α (rs = -0.629, P = 0.024).

OBJECTIVE: Although aberrant interactions between gut microbes and the intestinal immune system have been implicated in this skin disease, the nature of the microbiome dysfunction underlying the disease remains unclear. METHODS: The gut microbiome from 132 subjects, including 90 patients with AD, was analyzed by using 16S rRNA gene and metagenome sequence analyses. Reference genomes from the Human Microbiome Project and the KEGG Orthology database were used for metagenome analyses. Short-chain fatty acids in fecal samples were compared by using gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analyses. RESULTS: We show that enrichment of a subspecies of the major gut species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is strongly associated with AD. In addition, the AD microbiome was enriched in genes encoding the use of various nutrients that could be released from damaged gut epithelium, reflecting a bloom of auxotrophic bacteria. Fecal samples from patients with AD showed decreased levels of butyrate and propionate, which have anti-inflammatory effects. This is likely a consequence of an intraspecies compositional change in F prausnitzii that reduces the number of high butyrate and propionate producers, including those related to the strain A2-165, a lack of which has been implicated in patients with Crohn disease.

Although global microbiome composition was unchanged, viridans group Streptococci and streptococcal mevalonate pathway enzymes were lower among children continuing (n = 36) versus stopping (n = 36) cotrimoxazole. These changes were associated with lower fecal myeloperoxidase. To isolate direct effects of cotrimoxazole on immune activation from antibiotic effects, we established in vitro models of systemic and intestinal inflammation. In vitro cotrimoxazole had modest but consistent inhibitory effects on proinflammatory cytokine production by blood leukocytes from HIV-positive (n = 16) and HIV-negative (n = 8) UK adults and reduced IL-8 production by gut epithelial cell lines. Collectively we demonstrate that cotrimoxazole reduces systemic and intestinal inflammation both indirectly via antibiotic effects on the microbiome and directly by blunting immune and epithelial cell activation. Synergy between these pathways may explain the clinical benefits of cotrimoxazole despite high antimicrobial resistance, providing further rationale for extending coverage among people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.",Complete,

The relationship between gut microbiota and diabetes has rarely been studied in HIV-infected individuals, who have excess risk of metabolic disorders. METHODS: Our study during 2015-2016 enrolled predominantly African Americans and Hispanics in the Women's Interagency HIV Study. We studied 28 women with long-standing HIV infection under antiretroviral therapy and 20 HIV-uninfected, but at high risk of infection, women (16 HIV+ and 6 HIV- with diabetes). Fecal samples were analyzed by sequencing prokaryotic16S rRNA gene. Plasma metabolomics profiling was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. FINDINGS: No significant differences in bacterial α- or β-diversity were observed by diabetes or HIV serostatus (all P > .1). Relative abundances of four genera (Finegoldia, Anaerococcus, Sneathia, and Adlercreutzia) were lower in women with diabetes compared to those without diabetes (all P < .01). In women with diabetes, plasma levels of several metabolites in tryptophan catabolism (e,g., kynurenine/tryptophan ratio), branched-chain amino acid and proline metabolism pathways were higher, while glycerophospholipids were lower (all P < .05). Results were generally consistent between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women, and no significant modification effects by HIV serostatus were observed (all Pinteraction > 0.05). Anaerococcus, known to produce butyrate which is involved in anti-inflammation and glucose metabolism, showed an inverse correlation with kynurenine/tryptophan ratio (r = -0.38, P < .01). INTERPRETATION: Among women with or at high risk for HIV infection, diabetes is associated with gut microbiota and plasma metabolite alteration, including depletion of butyrate-producing bacterial population along with higher tryptophan catabolism.

Moreover, microbial translocation is associated with insufficient reconstitution of CD4+T cells, and contributes to the pathogenesis of immunologic non-response. In a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, we recently showed that, compared to placebo, 12 weeks treatment with probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii significantly reduced plasma levels of bacterial translocation (Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein or LBP) and systemic inflammation (IL-6) in 44 HIV virologically suppressed patients, half of whom (n = 22) had immunologic non-response to antiretroviral therapy (<270 CD4+Tcells/μL despite long-term suppressed viral load). The aim of the present study was to investigate if this beneficial effect of the probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii is due to modified gut microbiome composition, with a decrease of some species associated with higher systemic levels of microbial translocation and inflammation. In this study, we used 16S rDNA gene amplification and parallel sequencing to analyze the probiotic impact on the composition of the gut microbiome (faecal samples) in these 44 patients randomized to receive oral supplementation with probiotic or placebo for 12 weeks. Compared to the placebo group, in individuals treated with probiotic we observed lower concentrations of some gut species, such as those of the Clostridiaceae family, which were correlated with systemic levels of bacterial translocation and inflammation markers. In a sub-study of these patients, we observed significantly higher parameters of microbial translocation (LBP, soluble CD14) and systemic inflammation in immunologic non-responders than in immunologic responders, which was correlated with a relative abundance of specific gut bacterial groups (Lachnospiraceae genus and Proteobacteria). Thus, in this work, we propose a new therapeutic strategy using the probiotic yeast S. boulardii to modify gut microbiome composition. Identifying pro-inflammatory species in the gut microbiome could also be a useful new marker of poor immune response and a new therapeutic target.",Complete,

Here, we aim to study the gut microbiome and its role in inflammation in treated and untreated HIV-infected children. Examination of fecal microbiota revealed that perinatally infected children living with HIV had significantly higher levels of genus Prevotella that persisted despite ART.

The Prevotella positively correlated with IP-10 levels in both treated and untreated HIV-infected children, while genus Prevotella and species Prevotella copri was inversely associated with CD4 count. Relative abundance of genus Prevotella and species Prevotella copri showed positive correlation with sCD14 in ART-suppressed perinatally HIV-infected children.

METHODS: In this two-hospital cohort study, we obtained blood, stool and patient records from 100 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serial stool samples were collected from 27 of the 100 patients up to 30 days after clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Gut microbiome compositions were characterised by shotgun sequencing total DNA extracted from stools. Concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and blood markers were measured from plasma. RESULTS: Gut microbiome composition was significantly altered in patients with COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-19 individuals irrespective of whether patients had received medication (p<0.01). Several gut commensals with known immunomodulatory potential such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Eubacterium rectale and bifidobacteria were underrepresented in patients and remained low in samples collected up to 30 days after disease resolution. Moreover, this perturbed composition exhibited stratification with disease severity concordant with elevated concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and blood markers such as C reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase. CONCLUSION: Associations between gut microbiota composition, levels of cytokines and inflammatory markers in patients with COVID-19 suggest that the gut microbiome is involved in the magnitude of COVID-19 severity possibly via modulating host immune responses.

Methods: To determine the specific differential florae throughout the process of cervical cancer development, in the present study, 16S rRNA sequencing was combined with KEGG pathway enrichment analysis to analyse five groups of cervical scraping samples with increasing durations of HPV infection and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia pathological classification. Results: The findings revealed that decreasing levels of probiotics, including Shuttleworthia, Prevotella, Lactobacillus, and Sneathia, and increasing levels of pathogenic bacteria, including Dispar, Streptococcus, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, could be the direct result of early HPV infection. Other pathogenic bacteria, such as Bifidobacteriaceae, might represent key factors in cancer progression. Additionally, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that HPV infection directly inhibits multiple pathways, including those of sporulation, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, and ansamycin biosynthesis, which may lead to the development of early symptoms of cervical cancer.

Understanding the microbial composition and structure in women with high-risk (hr)-HPV infection may help reveal associations between the vaginal microbiota and HPV infection, and identify potential biomarkers. Our study investigated the vaginal microbial community in women with and without hr-HPV infection, by using 16s rRNA gene sequencing. We found that microbial perturbations occurred in the early phase of hr-HPV infection. Lactobacillus and Sporolactobacillus were decreased, while bacteria related to bacterial vaginosis (BV), such as Gardnerella, Prevotella, Dialister, Slackia, Actinomyces, Porphyromonas, Peptoniphilus, Anaerococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Streptococcus, Ureaplasma, Megasphaera, and Mycoplasma were increased. Our results could offer insights into the correlations between hr-HPV and the vaginal microbiota in the early infection period, and provide indications that the predominance of some BV-associated bacteria during hr-HPV infection may increase the risk for cervical neoplasia.",Complete,Lwaldron

We hypothesized that vaginal microbiota might be associated with the progression of CC. In this study, we enrolled 23 participants, including healthy controls (HC group; n = 7), patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2 and 3 (CIN group, n = 8), and patients with invasive cervical cancer (CAN group; n = 8). Amplicon sequencing was performed using the Ion Torrent PGM to characterize the vaginal microbiota. Patients with CIN and CAN presented vaginal microbiota dysbiosis compared with HC. The alpha diversity analysis revealed that CC has a trend to be increased in terms of diversity indexes. Moreover, CC was associated with the abundance of specific microbes, of which Lactobacillus and Gardnerella were the most significantly different between HC and CIN, whereas Streptococcus was differentially abundant in CAN compared with CIN. We then evaluated their diagnostic abilities. Testing in terms of diagnostic ability using the three genera revealed considerably high performance with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.982, 0.953, and 0.922.

METHODS: The vaginal bacterial composition of five groups, HPV-infected women without CINs (HPV, n = 78), women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL, n = 51), women with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL, n = 23), women with invasive cervical cancer (Cancer, n = 9) and healthy women without HPV infection (Normal, n = 68), was characterized by deep sequencing of barcoded 16S rRNA gene fragments (V3-4) using Illumina MiSeq. RESULTS: HPV infection increased vaginal bacterial richness and diversity regardless of the status of CINs. The vaginal bacterial richness and diversity were further augmented in women with cervical cancer. Lactobacillus was the most abundant genus in all groups. HPV infection had a negative influence on the abundances of Lactobacillus, Gardnerella and Atopobium. Accordingly, HPV infection increased the relative abundance of Prevotella, Bacillus, Anaerococcus, Sneathia, Megasphaera, Streptococcus and Anaerococcus. The increased proportions of Bacillus, Anaerococcus and the reduced abundance of Gradnerella vaginalis were probably related with the progression of CINs severity. HPV infection without CINs or cancerous lesions was strongly associated with Megasphaera. The most abundant bacterium in the LSIL group was Prevotella amnii. However, Prevotella timonensis, Shuttleworthia and Streptococcaceae at the family level were three taxa related to HSIL. Furthermore, more taxa were associated with the Cancer group including Bacillus, Sneathia, Acidovorax, Oceanobacillus profundus, Fusobacterium, Veillonellaceae at the family level, Anaerococcus and Porphyromonas uenonis. Samples in the Normal group were mostly assigned to CST III. HPV infection converted the vaginal bacterial community structure from CST III to CST IV. Furthermore, the proportions of CST IV were gradually augmented with the progression of the severity of CINs.

Sequences analysis was performed and according to subsequent statistical analysis, the structure of cervicovaginal microbiota of healthy and transient infection individuals is relatively single, Firmicutes occupy the main composition. However, that of the HPV persistent infection presented a complicated trend and the abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria was higher.

Bacillus and Ralstonia species that also increased significantly (5-10-fold) were also found to possess similar signaling and motility genes. In contrast, no such genes were found in oral commensal Prevotella, Veillonella and Neisseria species, which decreased significantly, or in either Acinetobacter or 10 out of 21 Streptococcus species, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. Our results support the notion that pH1N1 infection provides a niche for previously unnoticed potential respiratory pathogens that were able to access the lower respiratory tract with weakened immunity.",Complete,Fatima

Consequently, there is great interest in identifying, characterizing, and understanding factors that initiate these changes. Despite their high prevalence, studies have only recently begun to investigate how viral lung infections have an impact on the gut microbiota. There is also considerable interest in whether the gut microbiota could be manipulated during vaccination to improve efficacy. In this highly controlled study, we aimed to establish the effect of viral lung infection on gut microbiota composition and the gut environment using mouse models of common respiratory pathogens respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. This was then compared to the effect of live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) vaccination. Both RSV and influenza virus infection resulted in significantly altered gut microbiota diversity, with an increase in Bacteroidetes and a concomitant decrease in Firmicutes phyla abundance. Although the increase in the Bacteroidetes phylum was consistent across several experiments, differences were observed at the family and operational taxonomic unit level. This suggests a change in gut conditions after viral lung infection that favors Bacteroidetes outgrowth but not individual families. No change in gut microbiota composition was observed after LAIV vaccination, suggesting that the driver of gut microbiota change is specific to live viral infection. Viral lung infections also resulted in an increase in fecal lipocalin-2, suggesting low-grade gut inflammation, and colonic Muc5ac levels. Owing to the important role that mucus plays in the gut environment, this may explain the changes in microbiota composition observed. This study demonstrates that the gut microbiota and the gut environment are altered following viral lung infections and that these changes are not observed during vaccination. Whether increased mucin levels and gut inflammation drive, or are a result of, these changes is still to be determined.",Complete,

Only the class Synergistia and the genus TG5, which are related to periodontitis, were statistically more frequent in the control group. The similar microbiome profiles of medicated diabetics and the control group indicates that the relationship between the T2DM and the oral microbiome might be more related to either the lifestyle/diet rather than diabetes per se.

It is still controversial whether there is placental microbiota during a healthy pregnancy. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome in the offspring, and the mechanisms are unclear.

Methods: Placenta and cord blood samples were collected from eight GDM and seven euglycemic (control) term pregnancies in cesarean deliveries without evidence of clinical infections. The Illumina MiSeq Sequencing System was used to detect the microbiota based on the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Results: The microbiota were detectable in all placental samples. Comparing GDM vs. controls, there were more operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (mean ± SE = 373.63 ± 14.61 vs. 332.43 ± 9.92, P = 0.024) and higher ACE index (395.15 ± 10.56 vs. 356.27 ± 8.47, P = 0.029) and Chao index (397.67 ± 10.24 vs. 361.32 ± 8.87, P = 0.04).

Despite the dominant similarity in microbiota composition, at the OTU level, the abundance of Ruminococcus, Coprococcus, Paraprevotella, and Lactobacillus were higher, whereas Veillonella was lower in the placentas of GDM vs. controls. The microbiota was detected in one of the 15 cord blood samples, and its components were similar as to the corresponding placental microbiota at both phylum and genus levels suggesting placental microbiota as the potential source.

In addition to methodological variance, heterogeneity may be caused by both microbial and host response differences, which was addressed in this study. DESIGN: We prospectively studied the colonic microbiota and the expression of specific host response genes using faecal and mucosal samples ('ON' and 'OFF' the tumour, proximal and distal) from 59 patients undergoing surgery for CRC, 21 individuals with polyps and 56 healthy controls. Microbiota composition was determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing; expression of host genes involved in CRC progression and immune response was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: The microbiota of patients with CRC differed from that of controls, but alterations were not restricted to the cancerous tissue. Differences between distal and proximal cancers were detected and faecal microbiota only partially reflected mucosal microbiota in CRC. Patients with CRC can be stratified based on higher level structures of mucosal-associated bacterial co-abundance groups (CAGs) that resemble the previously formulated concept of enterotypes. Of these, Bacteroidetes Cluster 1 and Firmicutes Cluster 1 were in decreased abundance in CRC mucosa, whereas Bacteroidetes Cluster 2, Firmicutes Cluster 2, Pathogen Cluster and Prevotella Cluster showed increased abundance in CRC mucosa. CRC-associated CAGs were differentially correlated with the expression of host immunoinflammatory response genes. CONCLUSIONS: CRC-associated microbiota profiles differ from those in healthy subjects and are linked with distinct mucosal gene-expression profiles.

However, the patterns of microbial colonization during pregnancy in the absence of pregnancy gingivitis have rarely been studied. Characterization of the oral microbiome in pregnant women with healthy gingiva is an important initial step in understanding the role of the microbiome in progression to pregnancy gingivitis. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we compared the oral microbiome of pregnant women without gingivitis (healthy pregnancy) with pregnant women having gingivitis and nonpregnant healthy women to understand how pregnancy modifies the oral microbiome and induces progression to pregnancy gingivitis. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were collected from Chinese pregnant women with gingivitis (n = 10), healthy pregnant women (n = 10), and nonpregnant healthy women (n = 10). The Illumina MiSeq platform was used to perform 16S rRNA gene sequencing targeting the V4 region. RESULTS: The alpha and beta diversity was significantly different between pregnant and nonpregnant women, but minimal differences were observed between pregnant women with and without gingivitis. Interestingly, the oral bacterial community showed higher abundance of pathogenic taxa during healthy pregnancy as compared with nonpregnant women despite similar gingival and plaque index scores. However, when compared with overt pregnancy gingivitis, pathogenic taxa were less abundant during healthy pregnancy. PICRUSt analysis (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states) also suggested no difference in the functional capabilities of the microbiome during pregnancy, irrespective of gingival disease status. However, metabolic pathways related to amino acid metabolism were significantly increased in healthy pregnant women as compared with nonpregnant women. CONCLUSION: The presence of pathogenic taxa in healthy pregnancy and pregnancy gingivitis suggests that bacteria may be necessary for initiating disease development but progression to gingivitis may be influenced by the host environmental factors. More efforts are required to plan interventions aimed at sustaining health before the appearance of overt gingivitis. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this study draw attention to the importance of oral health maintenance during pregnancy, as women without any prenatal oral conditions are predisposed to the risk of developing pregnancy gingivitis. Hence, it is important to incorporate comprehensive assessment of oral health in the prenatal health care schedules. Pregnant woman should be screened for oral risks, counseled on proper oral hygiene and expected oral changes, and referred for dental treatment, when necessary.",Complete,Fatima

Due to the increasing prevalence and various complications, diabetes brings about a huge financial burden to DM patients. Nowadays, more and more studies reveal the relationship between diseases and gut microbial community. We aimed to explore the alteration in composition and function of the gut microbiome in T2DM patients. Methods: A total of 137 patients with diabetes and 179 age- and gender-matched healthy controls selected from the healthy people sample center in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were divided into the DM group and the Con group, respectively. We collected their venous blood for laboratory tests and stool samples for 16S rRNA sequencing. The comparison between the two groups including both composition and function of the gut microbiome is presented. Results: We found that the α-diversity of bacterial taxa in the DM group had an evident decrease compared to that in the Con group. At the phylum level, the DM group had an obvious decrease of Bacteroidetes and a marked increase of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. At the genus level, Bacteroides and Prevotella decreased the most while Escherichia-Shigella, Lachnospiraceae_incertae_sedis, Subdoligranulum, Enterococcus, and Klebsiella had different degrees of expansion in the DM group. The ROC based on 246 optimum OTUs had very high test efficiency with an AUC of 92.25% in the training set and 90.48% in the test set. As for prediction of metabolic function, the gut microbiome of DM patients was predicted to be more active in environmental information processing and human diseases but less in metabolism. Conclusion: We observed alteration of composition and function of the gut microbiome in the DM group. These changes may provide a new treatment strategy for DM patients and new research targets.",Complete,

This virus is highly transmissible among individuals through both droplets and aerosol leading to determine severe pneumonia. Among the various factors that can influence both the onset of disease and the severity of its complications, the microbiome composition has also been investigated. Recent evidence showed the possible relationship between gut, lung, nasopharyngeal, or oral microbiome and COVID-19, but very little is known about it. Therefore, we aimed to verify the relationships between nasopharyngeal microbiome and the development of either COVID-19 or the severity of symptoms. To this purpose, we analyzed, by next generation sequencing, the hypervariable V1-V2-V3 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients (n=18) and control (CO) individuals (n=12) using Microbiota solution A (Arrow Diagnostics). We found a significant lower abundance of Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria in COVID-19 patients in respect to CO (p=0.003 and p<0.0001, respectively) from the phylum up to the genus (p<0.001). The Fusobacterium periodonticum (FP) resulted as the most significantly reduced species in COVID-19 patients respect to CO. FP is reported as being able to perform the surface sialylation. Noteworthy, some sialic acids residues on the cell surface could work as additional S protein of SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 could use sialic acids as receptors to bind to the epithelium of the respiratory tract, promoting its clustering and the disease development. We can therefore speculate that the significant reduction of FP in COVID-19 patients could be directly or indirectly linked to the modulation of sialic acid metabolism. Finally, viral or environmental factors capable of interfering with sialic metabolism could determine a fall in the individual protection from SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are necessary to clarify the precise role of FP in COVID-19.",Complete,

The presence of the former two bacterial taxa was also confirmed by clinical cultures of respiratory specimens (expectorated sputum or nasal secretions) in 23.1% (3/13) of the severe cases. Finally, a time-dependent, secondary infection of B. cenocepacia with expressions of multiple virulence genes was demonstrated in one severely ill patient, which might accelerate his disease deterioration and death occurring one month after ICU admission. Our findings point to SARS-CoV-2-related microbial dysbiosis and various antibiotic-resistant respiratory microbes/pathogens in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to disease severity.

We investigated changes in fecal microbiomes of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and associations with severity and fecal shedding of virus. METHODS: We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing analyses of fecal samples from 15 patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, from February 5 through March 17, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 or 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge; disease was categorized as mild (no radiographic evidence of pneumonia), moderate (pneumonia was present), severe (respiratory rate ≥30/min, or oxygen saturation ≤93% when breathing ambient air), or critical (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or organ failure requiring intensive care). We compared microbiome data with those from 6 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 15 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed gut microbiome profiles in association with disease severity and changes in fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in fecal microbiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of opportunistic pathogens and depletion of beneficial commensals, at time of hospitalization and at all timepoints during hospitalization. Depleted symbionts and gut dysbiosis persisted even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (determined from throat swabs) and resolution of respiratory symptoms. The baseline abundance of Coprobacillus, Clostridium ramosum, and Clostridium hathewayi correlated with COVID-19 severity; there was an inverse correlation between abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (an anti-inflammatory bacterium) and disease severity. Over the course of hospitalization, Bacteroides dorei, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides massiliensis, and Bacteroides ovatus, which downregulate expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in murine gut, correlated inversely with SARS-CoV-2 load in fecal samples from patients. CONCLUSIONS: In a pilot study of 15 patients with COVID-19, we found persistent alterations in the fecal microbiome during the time of hospitalization, compared with controls. Fecal microbiota alterations were associated with fecal levels of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 severity. Strategies to alter the intestinal microbiota might reduce disease severity.",Complete,Chloe

Methods: We compared the clinical features and laboratory results of 187 moderate COVID-19 patients with fever and without fever and identified several inflammatory markers in patients with fever. Then, we performed gut metagenome-wide association study for 31 individuals to identify the microbes and their epitopes which have potential role in fever and hyperinflammation. Results: Among 187 moderate COVID-19 patients, 127 (67.9%) patients presented with fever. Lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells were significantly reduced, while AST, LDH, CRP, IL-6 and IL-10 were significantly elevated in patients with fever. Gut microbiome composition was significantly altered in patients with fever compared with those with non-fever. Opportunistic pathogens such as Enterococcus faecalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were enriched in patients with fever.

Fecal samples were collected for microbiota analysis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and culture methods, and the determination of organic acid levels using high-performance liquid chromatography. Abdominal gas was quantified by image analyses of abdominal X-ray films. Subjects completed a questionnaire for GI symptoms, quality of life (QOL) and negative emotion.

Data were analyzed using phylogenetic-based clustering (Unifrac), or an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) approach using a supervised machine learning tool (randomForest). Most samples were also hybridized to a microarray that can detect 8741 bacterial taxa (16S rRNA PhyloChip). RESULTS: Microbiomes associated with pediatric IBS were characterized by a significantly greater percentage of the class γ-proteobacteria (0.07% vs 0.89% of total bacteria, respectively; P < .05); 1 prominent component of this group was Haemophilus parainfluenzae.

We aimed to define microbial populations that can be used discriminate the fecal microbiota of patients with IBS from that of healthy subjects and correlate these with IBS intestinal symptom scores. METHODS: The microbiota composition was assessed by global and deep molecular analysis of fecal samples from 62 patients with IBS patients and 46 healthy individuals (controls). We used a comprehensive and highly reproducible phylogenetic microarray in combination with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The intestinal microbiota of IBS patients differed significantly (P = .0005) from that of controls. The microbiota of patients, compared with controls, had a 2-fold increased ratio of the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes (P = .0002). This resulted from an approximately 1.5-fold increase in numbers of Dorea, Ruminococcus, and Clostridium spp (P < .005); a 2-fold decrease in the number of Bacteroidetes (P < .0001); a 1.5-fold decrease in numbers of Bifidobacterium and Faecalibacterium spp (P < .05); and, when present, a 4-fold lower average number of methanogens (3.50 × 10(7) vs 8.74 × 10(6) cells/g feces; P = .003). Correlation analysis of the microbial groups and IBS symptom scores indicated the involvement of several groups of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in the pathogenesis of IBS. CONCLUSIONS: Global and deep molecular analysis of fecal samples indicates that patients with IBS have a different composition of microbiota.

To investigate whether age-related changes in the gut microbiome may mediate arterial dysfunction, we suppressed gut microbiota in young and old mice with a cocktail of broad-spectrum, poorly-absorbed antibiotics in drinking water for 3-4 weeks. In old mice, antibiotic treatment reversed endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffening and attenuated vascular oxidative stress and inflammation. To provide insight into age-related changes in gut microbiota that may underlie these observations, we show that ageing altered the abundance of microbial taxa associated with gut dysbiosis and increased plasma levels of the adverse gut-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide. The results of the present study provide the first proof-of-concept evidence that the gut microbiome is an important mediator of age-related arterial dysfunction and therefore may be a promising therapeutic target for preserving arterial function with ageing, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. ABSTRACT: Oxidative stress-mediated arterial dysfunction (e.g. endothelial dysfunction and large elastic artery stiffening) is the primary mechanism driving age-related cardiovascular diseases. Accumulating evidence suggests the gut microbiome modulates host physiology because dysregulation ('gut dysbiosis') has systemic consequences, including promotion of oxidative stress. The present study aimed to determine whether the gut microbiome modulates arterial function with ageing. We measured arterial function in young and older mice after 3-4 weeks of treatment with broad-spectrum, poorly-absorbed antibiotics to suppress the gut microbiome. To identify potential mechanistic links between the gut microbiome and age-related arterial dysfunction, we sequenced microbiota from young and older mice and measured plasma levels of the adverse gut-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). In old mice, antibiotics reversed endothelial dysfunction [area-under-the-curve carotid artery dilatation to acetylcholine in young: 345 ± 16 AU vs. old control (OC): 220 ± 34 AU, P < 0.01; vs. old antibiotic-treated (OA): 334 ± 15 AU; P < 0.01 vs. OC] and arterial stiffening (aortic pulse wave velocity in young: 3.62 ± 0.15 m  s-1  vs. OC: 4.43 ± 0.38 m  s-1 ; vs. OA: 3.52 ± 0.35 m  s-1 ; P = 0.03). These improvements were accompanied by lower oxidative stress and greater antioxidant enzyme expression. Ageing altered the abundance of gut microbial taxa associated with gut dysbiosis. Lastly, plasma TMAO was higher with ageing (young: 2.6 ± 0.4 μmol  L-1   vs. OC: 7.2 ± 2.0 μmol  L-1 ; P < 0.0001) and suppressed by antibiotic treatment (OA: 1.2 ± 0.2 μmol  L-1 ; P < 0.0001 vs. OC).

SUMMARY ANSWER: Mice with the persistence of endometrial lesions for 42 days develop a distinct composition of gut microbiota. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Disorders in the immune system play fundamental roles in changing the intestinal microbiota. No study has used high-throughput DNA sequencing to show how endometriosis changes the gut microbiota, although endometriosis is accompanied by abnormal cytokine expression and immune cell dysfunction. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study includes a prospective and randomized experiment on an animal endometriosis model induced via the intraperitoneal injection of endometrial tissues. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The mice were divided into endometriosis and mock groups and were sacrificed at four different time points for model confirmation and fecal sample collection. To detect gut microbiota, 16S ribosomal-RNA gene sequencing was performed. Alpha diversity was used to analyze the complexity and species diversity of the samples through six indices. Beta diversity analysis was utilized to evaluate the differences in species complexity. Principal coordinate analysis and unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means clustering were performed to determine the clustering features. The microbial features differentiating the fecal microbiota were characterized by linear discriminant analysis effect size method. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The endometriosis and mock mice shared similar diversity and richness of gut microbiota. However, different compositions of gut microbiota were detected 42 days after the modeling. Among the discriminative concrete features, the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was elevated in mice with endometriosis, indicating that endometriosis may induce dysbiosis. Bifidobacterium, which is known as a commonly used probiotic, was also increased in mice with endometriosis. LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: More control groups should be further studied to clarify the specificity of the dysbiosis induced by endometriosis. This study was performed only on mice. Thus, additional data acquired from patients with endometriosis are needed in future research. We only detected the changes of gut microbiota at 42 days after the modeling, while the long-term effect of endometriosis on gut microbiota remains poorly understood. Moreover, we only revealed a single effect of endometriosis on gut microbiota. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study provided the first comprehensive data on the association of endometriosis and gut microbiota from high-throughput sequencing technology.

Here we investigated microbial colonization in intrauterine environment and cystic fluid of women with and without endometriosis by molecular approach. STUDY DESIGN: This is a case-controlled biological study with a total of 32 women each with and without endometriosis. Among them, 16 each in these two groups of women received treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa). Pattern of microbial colonization in endometrial swabs and endometrioma/non-endometrioma cystic fluid was examined using broad-range polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) amplification of bacteria targeting 16S rRNA gene (rDNA). After quantification of index PCR product, 16S rDNA metagenome sequence analysis was done by Illumina Miseq system. RESULTS: A wide proportion (0.01-97.8%) of multiple bacteria was detected in both endometrial swabs and cystic fluid collected from women with and without endometriosis. 16S metagenome assay indicated that proportion of Lactobacillacae was significantly decreased (p<0.01) and of Streptococcaceae, Staphylococaceae, Enterobacteriaceae was significantly increased (p<0.05 for each) in GnRHa-treated women with endometriosis than in GnRHa-untreated women. While bacteria culture method failed to detect a single colony, 16S metagenome assay could detect significantly higher percentage of Streptococcaceae (p<0.01) and Staphylococaceae (p<0.05) in the cystic fluid derived from women with ovarian endometrioma comparing to that in cystic fluid collected from non-endometrioma cysts.

The gut microbiota can affect the physiological and pathological processes of humans through various pathways, such as those involving the nervous and endocrine systems and immunity, and it plays important roles in endocrine and inflammatory diseases. Whether the gut microbiota plays a role in EM has gradually attracted researchers' attention. In the present study, fecal and blood samples were collected from 12 patients with stage 3/4 EM and 12 healthy controls. We performed 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing to compare the gut microbiota between the EM and control groups. Serum levels of hormones and inflammatory cytokines were measured. We found that compared with the control group, the EM group had a lower α diversity of gut microbiota and a higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. The abundances of various taxa (such as Actinobacteria, Tenericutes, Blautia, Bifidobacterium, Dorea, and Streptococcus) were significantly different between the two groups. The taxon with the highest abundance in the EM group was Prevotella_7, and that in the control group was Coprococcus_2. The serum levels of E2 and IL-8 were significantly higher in the EM group than in the control group (E2: EM group 74.7 ± 22.5 pg/L vs CON group 47.9 ± 12.5 pg/L; IL-8: EM group 6.39 ± 1.59 pg/mL vs CON group 4.14 ± 0.73 pg/mL).

SUMMARY ANSWER: Antibiotic therapy reduces endometriosis progression in mice, possibly by reducing specific gut bacteria. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Endometriosis, a chronic condition causing abdominal pain and infertility, afflicts up to 10% of women between the ages of 25 and 40, ~5 million women in the USA. Current treatment strategies, including hormone therapy and surgery, have significant side effects and do not prevent recurrences. We have little understanding of why some women develop endometriosis and others do not. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Mice were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics or metronidazole, subjected to surgically-induced endometriosis and assayed after 21 days. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The volumes and weights of endometriotic lesions and histological signatures were analysed. Proliferation and inflammation in lesions were assessed by counting cells that were positive for the proliferation marker Ki-67 and the macrophage marker Iba1, respectively. Differences in faecal bacterial composition were assessed in mice with and without endometriosis, and faecal microbiota transfer studies were performed. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In mice treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, neomycin, metronidazole and ampicillin), endometriotic lesions were significantly smaller (~ 5-fold; P < 0.01) with fewer proliferating cells (P < 0.001) than those in mice treated with vehicle. Additionally, inflammatory responses, as measured by the macrophage marker Iba1 in lesions and IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and TGF-β1 in peritoneal fluid, were significantly reduced in mice treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics (P < 0.05). In mice treated with metronidazole only, but not in those treated with neomycin, ectopic lesions were significantly (P < 0.001) smaller in volume than those from vehicle-treated mice. Finally, oral gavage of faeces from mice with endometriosis restored the endometriotic lesion growth and inflammation (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively) in metronidazole-treated mice. LARGE-SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: These findings are from a mouse model of surgically-induced endometriosis. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism by which gut bacteria promote inflammation, identify bacterial genera or species that promote disease progression and assess the translatability of these findings to humans. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our findings suggest that gut bacteria promote endometriosis progression in mice. This finding if translated to humans, could aid in the development of improved diagnostic tools and personalised treatment strategies.

Non-target metabolomics was applied to detect the fecal metabolites of EMS mice. The 16s rRNA sequencing was used for clarifying the composition of the gut microbiota. The functional characteristics of gut microbiota were analyzed using the PICRUSt. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was utilized for determining the potential important differential metabolites, and the Spearman correlation coefficient was applied for expressing the correlation between the important differential metabolites and gut microbiota. RESULTS: A total of 156 named differential metabolites were screened. The diversity and the abundance of gut microbiota in EMS mice decreased. Eleven pathways were involved in the differential metabolites and the functional prediction of gut microbiota, among which the second bile acid biosynthesis and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) metabolism were the significant enrichment pathways. The increased abundance of chenodeoxycholic and ursodeoxycholic acids and the decreased abundance of ALA and 12,13-EOTrE were found in the feces of EMS mice.

Methods: We recruited 37 women with EM/AM-associated CPP, 25 women with chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) without EM/AM, and 66 women without CPPS into our study. All of the participants were free from human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.

Taxonomic and functional bioinformatics analyses were performed using t-test, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), MetaStat, and PICRUSt algorithms. Results: At the species level, EM/AM-associated CPP was found to be associated with a predominance of Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium disporicum, Alloscardovia omnicolens, and Veillonella montpellierensis, and a concomitant paucity of Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus iners. When the relative abundance of Clostridium disporicum was over 0.001105% and that of Lactobacillus reuteri was under 0.1911349%, the differential diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 81.08% and 52.0%, respectively.

Association of the gut microbiota with various diseases has been reported, though the specific components of the microbiota that affect the host response leading to disease remain unknown. However, there is limited information on the role of gut microbiota in RA. In this study we aimed to define a microbial and metabolite profile that could predict disease status. In addition, we aimed to generate a humanized model of arthritis to confirm the RA-associated microbe. METHODS: To identify an RA biomarker profile, the 16S ribosomal DNA of fecal samples from RA patients, first-degree relatives (to rule out environment/background as confounding factors), and random healthy non-RA controls were sequenced. Analysis of metabolites and their association with specific taxa was performed to investigate a potential mechanistic link. The role of an RA-associated microbe was confirmed using a human epithelial cell line and a humanized mouse model of arthritis. RESULTS: Patients with RA exhibited decreased gut microbial diversity compared with controls, which correlated with disease duration and autoantibody levels. A taxon-level analysis suggested an expansion of rare taxa, Actinobacteria, with a decrease in abundant taxa in patients with RA compared with controls. Prediction models based on the random forests algorithm suggested that three genera, Collinsella, Eggerthella, and Faecalibacterium, segregated with RA. The abundance of Collinsella correlated strongly with high levels of alpha-aminoadipic acid and asparagine as well as production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-17A. A role for Collinsella in altering gut permeability and disease severity was confirmed in experimental arthritis.

The impact of antibiotic therapy on the composition of the intestinal microbiota of a cross-section of elderly Irish subjects (n = 185, ≥ 65 years) was investigated, taking into consideration their residence location. METHODS: Forty-two of the 185 elderly subjects were treated with at least one antibiotic within 1 month prior to faecal microbiota profiling. The residence locations of the subjects varied from long-term nursing care and rehabilitation wards to day hospitals and the community. RESULTS: Culture-dependent methods indicated that faecal Bifidobacterium spp. numbers were significantly reduced following antibiotic treatment (P = 0.004, 7-fold reduction), while levels of Lactobacillus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae were unaffected. The largest decrease in Bifidobacterium spp. numbers was linked to the administration of nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors (P = 0.004, 23-fold reduction). Microbiota profiling revealed a significant compositional change across nine genera following antibiotic therapy, including a relative increase in Lactobacillus spp. (P = 0.031), as well as a decrease in the number of genera identified in the antibiotic-treated subjects (n = 58), when compared with untreated subjects (n = 79). More alterations in the intestinal microbiota were observed post-nucleic acid synthesis inhibitor therapy, most notably a decrease in relative Faecalibacterium spp. numbers (P < 0.001).

While their clinical benefits have been proved, concerns regarding the side-effects of their therapeutic use have been raised. Here we assess the short- and long-term impacts of azithromycin on the gut microbiota of young children. METHODS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a group of children aged 12-36 months, diagnosed with recurrent asthma-like symptoms from the COPSAC2010 cohort. Each acute asthma-like episode was randomized to a 3-day course of azithromycin oral solution of 10 mg/kg per day or placebo. Azithromycin reduced episode duration by half, which was the primary end-point and reported previously. The assessment of gut microbiota after treatment was the secondary end-point and reported in this study. Fecal samples were collected 14 days after randomization (N = 59, short-term) and again at age 4 years (N = 49, long-term, of whom N = 18 were placebo treated) and investigated by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. FINDINGS: Short-term, azithromycin caused a 23% reduction in observed richness and 13% reduction in Shannon diversity. Microbiota composition was shifted primarily in the Actinobacteria phylum, especially a reduction of abundance in the genus Bifidobacterium. Long-term (13-39 months after treatment), we did not observe any differences between the azithromycin and placebo recipients in their gut microbiota composition. INTERPRETATION: Azithromycin treatment induced a perturbation in the gut microbiota 14 days after randomization but did not have long-lasting effects on the gut microbiota composition. However, it should be noted that our analyses included a limited number of fecal samples for the placebo treated group at age 4 years.

METHODS: 16S gene ribosomal RNA sequencing was performed on fecal samples of 350 individuals, subdivided into idiopathic PD (n = 193, of whom 39 were drug naïve) stratified by disease duration, PSP (n = 22), MSA (n = 22), and healthy controls (HC; n = 113). Several confounders were taken into account, including dietary habits. RESULTS: Despite the fact that unadjusted comparison of PD and HC showed several differences in relative taxa abundances, the significant results were greatly reduced after adjusting for confounders. Although most of these differences were associated with disease duration, lower abundance in Lachnospiraceae was the only difference between de novo PD and HC (remaining lower across almost all PD duration strata). Decreased Lachnospiraceae and increased Lactobacillaceae and Christensenellaceae were associated with a worse clinical profile, including higher frequencies of cognitive impairment, gait disturbances, and postural instability. When compared with HC, MSA and PSP patients shared the changes in PD, with a few exceptions: in MSA, Lachnospiraceae were not lower, and Prevotellaceae were reduced; in PSP, Lactobacillaceae were similar, and Streptococcaceae were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbiota may be an environmental modulator of the pathogenesis of PD and contribute to the interindividual variability of clinical features.

METHODS: We conducted a case-control study of 88 individuals aged 4-18 years, which included 44 individuals with kidney stones containing ≥50% calcium oxalate and 44 controls matched for age, sex, and race. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were performed on stool samples. RESULTS: Participants who were kidney stone formers had a significantly less diverse gut microbiome compared with controls. Among bacterial taxa with a prevalence >0.1%, 31 taxa were less abundant among individuals with nephrolithiasis. These included seven taxa that produce butyrate and three taxa that degrade oxalate. The lower abundance of these bacteria was reflected in decreased abundance of the gene encoding butyryl-coA dehydrogenase (P=0.02). The relative abundance of these bacteria was correlated with the levels of 18 fecal metabolites, and levels of these metabolites differed in individuals with kidney stones compared with controls. The oxalate-degrading bacterial taxa identified as decreased in those who were kidney stone formers were components of a larger abundance correlation network that included Eggerthella lenta and several Lactobacillus species. The microbial (α) diversity was associated with age of stone onset, first decreasing and then increasing with age. For the individuals who were stone formers, we found the lowest α diversity among individuals who first formed stones at age 9-14 years, whereas controls displayed no age-related differences in diversity.

This study aimed to elucidate gut microbiome's role in RA pathology by a comprehensive metagenome-wide association study (MWAS). METHODS: We conducted MWAS of the RA gut microbiome in the Japanese population (n case=82, n control=42) by using whole-genome shotgun sequencing of high depth (average 13 Gb per sample). Our MWAS consisted of three major bioinformatic analytic pipelines (phylogenetic analysis, functional gene analysis and pathway analysis). RESULTS: Phylogenetic case-control association tests showed high abundance of multiple species belonging to the genus Prevotella (e.g., Prevotella denticola) in the RA case metagenome. The non-linear machine learning method efficiently deconvoluted the case-control phylogenetic discrepancy. Gene functional assessments showed that the abundance of one redox reaction-related gene (R6FCZ7) was significantly decreased in the RA metagenome compared with controls. A variety of biological pathways including those related to metabolism (e.g., fatty acid biosynthesis and glycosaminoglycan degradation) were enriched in the case-control comparison. A population-specific link between the metagenome and host genome was identified by comparing biological pathway enrichment between the RA metagenome and the RA genome-wide association study results. No apparent discrepancy in alpha or beta diversities of metagenome was found between RA cases and controls.

Antibiotics may disrupt these coevolved interactions, leading to acute or chronic disease in some individuals. Our understanding of antibiotic-associated disturbance of the microbiota has been limited by the poor sensitivity, inadequate resolution, and significant cost of current research methods. The use of pyrosequencing technology to generate large numbers of 16S rDNA sequence tags circumvents these limitations and has been shown to reveal previously unexplored aspects of the ""rare biosphere."" We investigated the distal gut bacterial communities of three healthy humans before and after treatment with ciprofloxacin, obtaining more than 7,000 full-length rRNA sequences and over 900,000 pyrosequencing reads from two hypervariable regions of the rRNA gene. A companion paper in PLoS Genetics (see Huse et al., doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000255) shows that the taxonomic information obtained with these methods is concordant. Pyrosequencing of the V6 and V3 variable regions identified 3,300-5,700 taxa that collectively accounted for over 99% of the variable region sequence tags that could be obtained from these samples. Ciprofloxacin treatment influenced the abundance of about a third of the bacterial taxa in the gut, decreasing the taxonomic richness, diversity, and evenness of the community. However, the magnitude of this effect varied among individuals, and some taxa showed interindividual variation in the response to ciprofloxacin. While differences of community composition between individuals were the largest source of variability between samples, we found that two unrelated individuals shared a surprising degree of community similarity. In all three individuals, the taxonomic composition of the community closely resembled its pretreatment state by 4 weeks after the end of treatment, but several taxa failed to recover within 6 months. These pervasive effects of ciprofloxacin on community composition contrast with the reports by participants of normal intestinal function and with prior assumptions of only modest effects of ciprofloxacin on the intestinal microbiota. These observations support the hypothesis of functional redundancy in the human gut microbiota. The rapid return to the pretreatment community composition is indicative of factors promoting community resilience, the nature of which deserves future investigation.",Incomplete,

Methods: Fifty-nine patients with JIA (mean age, 12.6 ± 2.7 years) and 34 healthy controls (HC; mean age 12.3 ± 3.0 years) were consecutively recruited in this Norwegian cross-sectional study. Information about demographics, disease activity, medication history, frequency of tooth brushing and a modified version of the gingival bleeding index (GBI) and the simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S) was obtained. Microbiome profiling of saliva samples was performed by sequencing of the V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene, coupled with a species-level taxonomy assignment algorithm; QIIME, LEfSe and R-package for Spearman correlation matrix were used for downstream analysis. Results: There were no significant differences between JIA and HC in alpha- and beta-diversity. However, differential abundance analysis revealed several taxa to be associated with JIA: TM7-G1, Solobacterium and Mogibacterium at the genus level; and Leptotrichia oral taxon 417, TM7-G1 oral taxon 352 and Capnocytophaga oral taxon 864 among others, at the species level. Haemophilus species, Leptotrichia oral taxon 223, and Bacillus subtilis, were associated with healthy controls.

We find that while fermentable (inulin), but not insoluble (cellulose), fiber markedly protected mice against high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic syndrome, the effect was not significantly impaired by either inhibiting SCFA production or genetic ablation of GPR43. Rather, HFD decimates gut microbiota, resulting in loss of enterocyte proliferation, leading to microbiota encroachment, low-grade inflammation (LGI), and metabolic syndrome. Enriching HFD with inulin restored microbiota loads, interleukin-22 (IL-22) production, enterocyte proliferation, and antimicrobial gene expression in a microbiota-dependent manner, as assessed by antibiotic and germ-free approaches.

METHODS: Prospective profiling and comparison of vaginal bacteria composition using 16S rRNA gene-based metataxonomics from 5 weeks' gestation in pregnancies ending in miscarriage or uncomplicated term deliveries matched for age, gestation and body mass index. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative vaginal bacteria abundance, diversity and richness. Pregnancy outcomes defined as first or second trimester miscarriage, or uncomplicated term delivery. RESULTS: First trimester miscarriage associated with reduced prevalence of Lactobacillus spp.-dominated vaginal microbiota classified using hierarchical clustering analysis (65.6 versus 87.7%; P = 0.005), higher alpha diversity (mean Inverse Simpson Index 2.5 [95% confidence interval 1.8-3.0] versus 1.5 [1.3-1.7], P = 0.003) and higher richness 25.1 (18.5-31.7) versus 16.7 (13.4-20), P = 0.017), compared with viable pregnancies.

RESULTS: Samples of gastrointestinal tract (GIT), pharyngeal cavity and vaginal microbiota were collected with consent from 22 patients at three time points relative to the gepotidacin dosing regimen; Day 1 (pre-dose), Day 5 (end of dosing) and Follow-up (Day 28 ± 3 days). Microbiota composition was determined by DNA sequencing of 16S rRNA gene variable region 4 amplicons. By Day 5, significant changes were observed in the microbiome diversity relative to pre-dose across the tested body-sites. However, by the Follow-up visit, microbiome diversity changes were reverted to compositions comparable to Day 1. The greatest range of microbiome changes by body-site were GIT followed by the pharyngeal cavity then vagina. In Follow-up visit samples we found no statistically significant occurrences of pathogenic taxa. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that gepotidacin alteration of the human microbiome after 5 days of dosing is temporary and rebound to pre-dosing states is evident within the first month post-treatment.

As gastrointestinal dysfunction often precedes or parallels motor symptoms, the enteric system with its vast diversity of microorganisms may be involved in PD pathogenesis. Alterations in the enteric microbial taxonomic level of L-DOPA-naïve PD patients might also serve as a biomarker. METHODS: We performed metagenomic shotgun analyses and compared the fecal microbiomes of 31 early stage, L-DOPA-naïve PD patients to 28 age-matched controls. RESULTS: We found increased Verrucomicrobiaceae (Akkermansia muciniphila) and unclassified Firmicutes, whereas Prevotellaceae (Prevotella copri) and Erysipelotrichaceae (Eubacterium biforme) were markedly lowered in PD samples. The observed differences could reliably separate PD from control with a ROC-AUC of 0.84. Functional analyses of the metagenomes revealed differences in microbiota metabolism in PD involving the ẞ-glucuronate and tryptophan metabolism. While the abundances of prophages and plasmids did not differ between PD and controls, total virus abundance was decreased in PD participants. Based on our analyses, the intake of either a MAO inhibitor, amantadine, or a dopamine agonist (which in summary relates to 90% of PD patients) had no overall influence on taxa abundance or microbial functions. CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed differences of colonic microbiota and of microbiota metabolism between PD patients and controls at an unprecedented detail not achievable through 16S sequencing.

Objective: We evaluated the possible effects of dietary fiber on the fecal microbiota of patients with A-CRA.

Design: Patients with a diagnosis of A-CRA by pathological examination were enrolled in the A-CRA group. Patients with no obvious abnormalities or histopathological changes were enrolled in the healthy control (HC) group. Dietary fiber intake was assessed in all patients. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in feces were detected by gas chromatography. The fecal microbiota community was analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing based on 16S ribosomal RNA.

Results: Lower dietary fiber patterns and consistently lower SCFA production were observed in the A-CRA group (n = 344). Principal component analysis showed distinct differences in the fecal microbiota communities of the 2 groups.

The results highlighted the presence of different bacterial compositions; in particular, the fecal samples of CRC patients seemed to be enriched with Bacteroidetes, whereas in the fecal samples of healthy controls Firmicutes were one of the major phyla detected though these differences were not statistically significant. The CT samples showed the highest alpha diversity values. These results emphasize a different taxonomic composition of feces from CRC compared to healthy controls.

This study examined the composition of the gut microbiome in smokers compared with nonsmokers. AIMS AND METHODS: Stool samples were collected in a cross-sectional study of 249 participants selected from the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study in Bangladesh. Microbial DNA was extracted from the fecal samples and sequenced by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The associations of smoking status and intensity of smoking with the relative abundance or the absence and presence of individual bacterial taxon from phylum to genus levels were examined. RESULTS: The relative abundance of bacterial taxa along the Erysipelotrichi-to-Catenibacterium lineage was significantly higher in current smokers compared to never-smokers. The odds ratio comparing the mean relative abundance in current smokers with that in never-smokers was 1.91 (95% confidence interval = 1.36-2.69) for the genus Catenibacterium and 1.89 (95% confidence interval = 1.39-2.56) for the family Erysipelotrichaceae, the order Erysipelotrichale, and the class Erysipelotrichi (false discovery rate-adjusted p values = .0008-.01). A dose-response association was observed for each of these bacterial taxa. The presence of Alphaproteobacteria was significantly greater comparing current with never-smokers (odds ratio = 4.85, false discovery rate-adjusted p values = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Our data in a Bangladeshi population are consistent with evidence of an association between smoking status and dosage with change in the gut bacterial composition. IMPLICATIONS: This study for the first time examined the relationship between smoking and the gut microbiome composition.

Thus, microbial dysbiosis and their metabolites associated with CRC, based on stool samples, may be used to advantage to provide an excellent opportunity to find possible biomarkers for the screening, early detection, prevention, and treatment of CRC. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing coupled with statistical analysis, this study analyzed the cause-effect shift of the microbial taxa and their metabolites that was associated with the fecal gut microbiota of 17 healthy controls, 21 polyps patients, and 21 cancer patients. The microbial taxonomic shift analysis revealed striking differences among the healthy control, polyps and cancer groups. At the phylum level, Synergistetes was reduced significantly in the polyps group compared to the healthy control and cancer group. Additionally, at the genus level and in association with the cancer group, a total of 12 genera were highly enriched in abundance. In contrast, only Oscillosprira was significantly higher in abundance in the healthy control group. Comparisons of the polyps and cancer groups showed a total of 18 significantly enriched genera. Among them, 78% of the genera associated with the cancer group were in higher abundance, whereas the remaining genera showed a higher abundance in the polyps group. Additionally, the comparison of healthy control and polyp groups showed six significantly abundant genera. More than 66% of these genera showed a reduced abundance in the polyps group than in healthy controls, whereas the remaining genera were highly abundant in the polyps group. Based on tumor presence and absence, the abundance of Olsenella and Lactobacillus at the genus level was significantly reduced in the patient group compared to healthy controls. The significant microbial function prediction revealed an increase in the abundance of metabolites in the polyps and cancer groups compared to healthy controls. A correlation analysis revealed a higher contribution of Dorea in the predicted functions.

RESULTS: We show that RHI is followed by increased fecal adenovirus shedding, which persists during chronic HIV-1 infection and does not resolve with ART. Recent HIV-1 infection is also followed by transient non-HIV-specific changes in the gut bacterial richness and composition. Despite early resilience to change, an HIV-1-specific signature in the gut bacteriome-featuring depletion of Akkermansia, Anaerovibrio, Bifidobacterium, and Clostridium-previously associated with chronic inflammation, CD8+ T cell anergy, and metabolic disorders, can be eventually identified in chronically HIV-1-infected subjects.

Men who have sex with men (MSM) are very likely to be an independent influencing factor of the gut microbiome, but relevant research is still lacking. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis by screening 12 published studies of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of gut microbiomes related to HIV/AIDS (six of these studies contain data that is relevant and available to MSM) from NCBI and EBI databases. The analysis of gut microbiomes related to HIV infection status and MSM status included 1,288 samples (HIV-positive (HIV+) individuals, n = 744; HIV-negative (HIV-) individuals, n = 544) and 632 samples (MSM, n = 328; non-MSM, n = 304), respectively. The alpha diversity indexes, beta diversity indexes, differentially enriched genera, differentially enriched species, and differentially enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional pathways related to gut microbiomes were calculated. Finally, the overall trend of the above indicators was evaluated. Results: Our results indicate that HIV+ status is associated with decreased alpha diversity of the gut microbiome. MSM status is an important factor that affects the study of HIV-related gut microbiomes; that is, MSM are associated with alpha diversity changes in the gut microbiome regardless of HIV infection, and the changes in the gut microbiome composition of MSM are more significant than those of HIV+ individuals. A consistent change in Bacteroides caccae, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides uniformis, and Prevotella stercorea was found in HIV+ individuals and MSM. The differential expression of the gut microbiome may be accompanied by changes in functional pathways of carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and lipid Metabolism.

Although HIV-associated gut dysbiosis has been suggested to be involved in sustained chronic inflammation, there remains a limited understanding of the association between gut dysbiosis and chronic inflammation during HIV infection. Here, we investigated compositional changes in the gut microbiome and its role in chronic inflammation in patients infected with HIV. We observed that the gut microbiomes of patients with low CD4 counts had reduced alpha diversity compared to those in uninfected controls. Following CD4 recovery, alpha diversity was restored, but intergroup dissimilarity of bacterial composition remained unchanged between patients and uninfected controls. Patients with HIV had higher abundance of the classes Negativicutes, Bacilli, and Coriobacteriia, as well as depletion of the class Clostridia. These relative abundances positively correlated with inflammatory cytokines and negatively correlated with anti-inflammatory cytokines. We found that gut dysbiosis accompanying HIV infection was characterized by a depletion of obligate anaerobic Clostridia and enrichment of facultative anaerobic bacteria, reflecting increased intestinal oxygen levels and intestinal permeability. Furthermore, it is likely that HIV-associated dysbiosis shifts the immunological balance toward inflammatory Th1 responses and encourages proinflammatory cytokine production. Our results suggest that gut dysbiosis contributes to sustaining chronic inflammation in patients with HIV infection despite effective antiretroviral therapy and that correcting gut dysbiosis will be effective in improving long-term outcomes in patients. IMPORTANCE Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of HIV infection and is associated with the development and progression of age-related comorbidities. Although the gastrointestinal tract is a major site of HIV replication and CD4+ T-cell depletion, the role of HIV-associated imbalance of gut microbiome in chronic inflammation is unclear. Here, we aimed to understand the causal relationship between abnormalities in the gut microbiome and chronic inflammation in patients with HIV. Our results suggest HIV-associated gut dysbiosis presents a more aerobic environment than that of healthy individuals, despite prolonged viral suppression. This dysbiosis likely results from a sustained increase in intestinal permeability, which supports sustained bacterial translocation in HIV patients, despite effective therapy. Additionally, we observed that several bacterial taxa enriched in HIV patients were associated with increased expression of inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, these results suggest that gut dysbiosis plays an important role in chronic inflammation in HIV patients.",Complete,Claregrieve1

The foreskin is a major site of viral entry in heterosexual transmission of HIV. Although the probability of acquiring HIV from a sexual encounter is low, the risk varies even after adjusting for known HIV risk factors. The genital microbiome may account for some of the variability in risk by interacting with the host immune system to trigger inflammatory responses that mediate the infection of mucosal immune cells. We conducted a case-control study of uncircumcised participants nested within a randomized-controlled trial of male circumcision in Rakai, Uganda. Using penile (coronal sulcus) swabs collected by study personnel at trial enrollment, we characterized the penile microbiome by sequencing and real-time PCR and cytokine levels by electrochemiluminescence assays. The absolute abundances of penile anaerobes at enrollment were associated with later risk of HIV seroconversion, with a 10-fold increase in Prevotella, Dialister, Finegoldia, and Peptoniphilus increasing the odds of HIV acquisition by 54 to 63%, after controlling for other known HIV risk factors. Increased abundances of anaerobic bacteria were also correlated with increased cytokines, including interleukin-8, which can trigger an inflammatory response that recruits susceptible immune cells, suggesting a mechanism underlying the increased risk. These same anaerobic genera can be shared between heterosexual partners and are associated with increased HIV acquisition in women, pointing to anaerobic dysbiosis in the genital microbiome and an accompanying inflammatory response as a novel, independent, and transmissible risk factor for HIV infection.IMPORTANCE We found that uncircumcised men who became infected by HIV during a 2-year clinical trial had higher levels of penile anaerobes than uncircumcised men who remained HIV negative. We also found that having higher levels of penile anaerobes was also associated with higher production of immune factors that recruit HIV target cells to the foreskin, suggesting that anaerobes may modify HIV risk by triggering inflammation.

This state of the vaginal microbiota was associated with a low or intermediate Nugent score and was not identical to bacterial vaginosis, an HIV transmission risk factor. The placebo arm contained a higher proportion of communities dominated by Lactobacillus spp., particularly L. crispatus, throughout treatment. The data suggest that molecular evaluation of microbicide effects on vaginal microbiota may be a critical endpoint that should be incorporated in early clinical assessment of microbicide candidates. IMPORTANCE: Despite large prevention efforts, HIV transmission and acquisition rates remain unacceptably high. In developing countries, transmission mainly occurs through heterosexual intercourse, where women are significantly more vulnerable to infection than men. Vaginal microbicides are considered to be one of the most promising female-controlled products, in that women themselves insert the microbicides into the vagina to prevent HIV transmission during sexual intercourse. The failure of several microbicides in clinical trials has raised questions concerning the low in vivo efficacy of such anti-HIV molecules. This study was designed to gain insights into the failures of two microbicides by testing the hypothesis that the microbicides negatively affect a critical line of defense against HIV, the vaginal microbiota. The results suggest that in the early assessment of candidate microbicides, culture-independent evaluation of their effect on the vaginal microbiota should be considered and may constitute a critical endpoint.",Complete,

Here, we performed meta-analyses on 13 fecal metagenome data sets of the three diseases. We identified 87 species and 65 pathway markers that were consistently changed in multiple data sets of the same diseases. According to their overall trends, we grouped the disease-enriched marker species into disease-specific and disease-common clusters and revealed their distinct phylogenetic relationships; species in the CD-specific cluster were phylogenetically related, while those in the CRC-specific cluster were more distant. Strikingly, UC-specific species were phylogenetically closer to CRC, likely because UC patients have higher risk of CRC. Consistent with their phylogenetic relationships, marker species had similar within-cluster and different between-cluster metabolic preferences. A portion of marker species and pathways correlated with an indicator of leaky gut, suggesting a link between gut dysbiosis and human-derived contents. Marker species showed more coordinated changes and tighter inner-connections in cases than the controls, suggesting that the diseased gut may represent a stressed environment and pose stronger selection on gut microbes.

METHODS: Fecal microbiota communities from 80 patients with PD and 77 age and gender-matched controls were assessed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Diet and comorbidities were controlled in the analyses. Plasma concentrations of IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-18, GM-CSF, IFNγ, and TNFα were measured by a multiplex immunoassay and relationships between microbiota, clinical characteristics, and cytokine levels were analyzed in the PD group. We further examined the cytokine changes associated with the altered gut microbiota seen in patients with PD in another independent cohort of 120 PD patients and 120 controls. RESULTS: Microbiota from patients with PD was altered relative to controls and dominated by Verrucomicrobia, Mucispirillum, Porphyromonas, Lactobacillus, and Parabacteroides. In contrast, Prevotella was more abundant in controls. The abundances of Bacteroides were more increased in patients with non-tremor PD subtype than patients with tremor subtype. Bacteroides abundance was correlated with motor symptom severity defined by UPDRS part III motor scores (rho = 0.637 [95% confidence interval 0.474 to 0.758], P < 0.01).

Stool samples from patients with confirmed PD and Thy1-αSyn mice were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. Compared to healthy controls, the relative abundance of mucin-degrading Verrucomicrobiae and LPS-producing Gammaproteobacteria were greater in PD patients. In mice, the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria was negligible in both Thy1-αSyn and wild-type (WT) animals, while Verrucomicrobiae were reduced in Thy1-αSyn mice. The effect of LPS on intestinal barrier function was investigated in vitro using intestinal epithelial (IEC-6) cells, and in vivo via administration of LPS in drinking water to Thy1-αSyn mice. Acute exposure to LPS in vitro resulted in a reduction and altered distribution of the tight junction markers ZO-1 and e-Cadherin around the cell membrane in IEC-6 cells, as shown by immunohistochemistry. LPS administration in Thy1-αSyn mice resulted in the emergence of early motor manifestations at 10 weeks, compared to untreated mice who were still asymptomatic at this age.

RESULTS: All individuals underwent detailed clinical assessment, including neurological examinations and neuropsychological tests followed by self-reporting questionnaires.

PD-associated microbial patterns statistically depended on sex, age, BMI, and constipation. Particularly, the relative abundances of Bilophila and Paraprevotella were significantly associated with the Hoehn and Yahr staging after controlling for the disease duration. Furthermore, personalised metabolic modelling of the gut microbiomes revealed PD-associated metabolic patterns in the predicted secretion potential of nine microbial metabolites in PD, including increased methionine and cysteinylglycine.

METHODS: The faecal microbiota from 14 C-IBS women and 12 sex-match healthy subjects were examined through a combined strictly anaerobic cultural evaluation of functional groups of microbes and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (16S rDNA gene targeting probes) to quantify main groups of bacteria. Starch fermentation by C-IBS and healthy faecal samples was evaluated in vitro. RESULTS: In C-IBS, the numbers of lactate-producing and lactate-utilising bacteria and the number of H(2) -consuming populations, methanogens and reductive acetogens, were at least 10-fold lower (P < 0.05) compared with control subjects.

However, when and how microbial communities within each body niche acquire unique taxonomical and functional signatures in early life remains underexplored. We thus sought to determine the taxonomic composition and potential metabolic function of the neonatal and early infant microbiota across multiple body sites and assess the effect of the mode of delivery and its potential confounders or modifiers. A cohort of pregnant women in their early third trimester (n = 81) were prospectively enrolled for longitudinal sampling through 6 weeks after delivery, and a second matched cross-sectional cohort (n = 81) was additionally recruited for sampling once at the time of delivery. Samples across multiple body sites, including stool, oral gingiva, nares, skin and vagina were collected for each maternal-infant dyad. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing and sequencing analysis of the gene encoding the 16S rRNA were performed to interrogate the composition and function of the neonatal and maternal microbiota. We found that the neonatal microbiota and its associated functional pathways were relatively homogeneous across all body sites at delivery, with the notable exception of the neonatal meconium. However, by 6 weeks after delivery, the infant microbiota structure and function had substantially expanded and diversified, with the body site serving as the primary determinant of the composition of the bacterial community and its functional capacity. Although minor variations in the neonatal (immediately at birth) microbiota community structure were associated with the cesarean mode of delivery in some body sites (oral gingiva, nares and skin; R2 = 0.038), this was not true for neonatal stool (meconium; Mann-Whitney P > 0.05), and there was no observable difference in community function regardless of delivery mode. For infants at 6 weeks of age, the microbiota structure and function had expanded and diversified with demonstrable body site specificity (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.189) but without discernable differences in community structure or function between infants delivered vaginally or by cesarean surgery (P = 0.057, R2 = 0.007).

The pathogenesis of dementia has not been fully elucidated yet. Inflammatory processes are hypothesized to play an important role as a driver for cognitive decline but the origin of inflammation is not clear. We hypothesize that disturbances in gut microbiome composition, gut barrier dysfunction, bacterial translocation and resulting inflammation are associated with cognitive dysfunction in dementia. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, a cohort of 23 patients with dementia and 18 age and sex matched controls without cognitive impairments were studied. Gut microbiome composition, gut barrier dysfunction, bacterial translocation and inflammation were assessed from stool and serum samples. Malnutrition was assessed by Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form (MNA-SF), detailed information on drug use was collected. Microbiome composition was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing, QIIME 2 and Calypso 7.14 tools. RESULTS: Dementia was associated with dysbiosis characterized by differences in beta diversity and changes in taxonomic composition. Gut permeability was increased as evidenced by increased serum diamine oxidase (DAO) levels and systemic inflammation was confirmed by increased soluble cluster of differentiation 14 levels (sCD14). BMI and statin use had the strongest impact on microbiome composition. CONCLUSION: Dementia is associated with changes in gut microbiome composition and increased biomarkers of gut permeability and inflammation.

We used multiplexed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to characterize bacterial communities from mothers and their newborn babies, four born vaginally and six born via Cesarean section. Mothers' skin, oral mucosa, and vagina were sampled 1 h before delivery, and neonates' skin, oral mucosa, and nasopharyngeal aspirate were sampled <5 min, and meconium <24 h, after delivery. We found that in direct contrast to the highly differentiated communities of their mothers, neonates harbored bacterial communities that were undifferentiated across multiple body habitats, regardless of delivery mode. Our results also show that vaginally delivered infants acquired bacterial communities resembling their own mother's vaginal microbiota, dominated by Lactobacillus, Prevotella, or Sneathia spp., and C-section infants harbored bacterial communities similar to those found on the skin surface, dominated by Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium spp. These findings establish an important baseline for studies tracking the human microbiome's successional development in different body habitats following different delivery modes, and their associated effects on infant health.",Complete,Lwaldron

This study aimed to evaluate the microbiota in early/invasive CRC utilizing stool and cytological brushes to determine differences in relative abundance (RA).

Methods: Colonoscopy patients referred for endoscopic submucosal dissection or previous to CRC surgery were prospectively enrolled. Stool was collected pre-bowel preparation; and brush samples were taken during colonoscopy (three regions). DNA extraction, 16S rRNA next generation sequencing, and biostatistics (qiime and stamp software packages) followed. Primary outcome was the difference in RA of the Fusobacterium genus between the groups. Secondary outcomes included analyses of other microbiota.

Results: Twenty-five patients were included, of which 14 had invasive cancer (≥ 1000 mm into the submucosa). The three major genera for invasive cancer were Bacterioides, Oribacterium, and Fusobacterium, whereas for early cancer were Oribacterium, Bacterioides, and Prevotella (decreasing order of RA). There was a significantly higher RA of Fusobacterium in the invasive cancer group (9.65% vs 0.95%, respectively, P < 0.001). The RA of all genera was similar throughout the colon. In addition to Fusobacterium, the genera Corynebacterium, Enterococcus, Neisseria, Porphyromonas, and Sclegelella showed statistically higher RA in the invasive cancer group. Conversely, the genera Oribacterium, Desulfovibrio, Clostridiales, and Lactobacillus showed lower RA in the invasive cancer group.

Aims: To evaluate the effect of aspirin on the gut microbiome in a double-blinded, randomised placebo-controlled pilot trial.

Methods: Healthy volunteers aged 50-75 received a standard dose of aspirin (325 mg, N = 30) or placebo (N = 20) once daily for 6 weeks and provided stool samples every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. Serial measurements of gut microbial community composition and bacterial abundance were derived from 16S rRNA sequences. Linear discriminant analysis of effect size (LEfSe) was tested for between-arm differences in bacterial abundance. Mixed-effect regression with binomial distribution estimated the effect of aspirin use on changes in the relative abundance of individual bacterial taxa via an interaction term (treatment × time).

Results: Over the study period, there were differences in microbial composition in the aspirin vs placebo arm. After treatment, four taxa were differentially abundant across arms: Prevotella, Veillonella, Clostridium XlVa and Clostridium XVIII clusters. Of pre-specified bacteria associated with CRC (n = 8) or aspirin intake (n = 4) in published studies, interactions were significant for four taxa, suggesting relative increases in Akkermansia, Prevotella and Ruminococcaceae and relative decreases in Parabacteroides, Bacteroides and Dorea in the aspirin vs placebo arm.

Conclusion: Compared to placebo, aspirin intake influenced several microbial taxa (Ruminococcaceae, Clostridium XlVa, Parabacteroides and Dorea) in a direction consistent with a priori hypothesis based on their association with CRC.

We conducted a multi-omic study of 46 lean and obese East Asian and White participants living in the San Francisco Bay Area, revealing marked differences between ethnic groups in bacterial richness and community structure. White individuals were enriched for the mucin-degrading Akkermansia muciniphila. East Asian subjects had increased levels of multiple bacterial phyla, fermentative pathways detected by metagenomics, and the short-chain fatty acid end-products acetate, propionate, and isobutyrate. Differences in the gut microbiota between the East Asian and White subjects could not be explained by dietary intake, were more pronounced in lean individuals, and were associated with current geographical location. Microbiome transplantations into germ-free mice demonstrated stable diet- and host genotype-independent differences between the gut microbiotas of East Asian and White individuals that differentially impact host body composition. Taken together, our findings add to the growing body of literature describing microbiome variations between ethnicities and provide a starting point for defining the mechanisms through which the microbiome may shape disparate health outcomes in East Asians. The community of microbes living in the human gut varies based on where a person lives, in part because of differences in diets but also due to factors still incompletely understood. In turn, this ‘microbiome’ may have wide-ranging effects on health and diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Many scientists want to understand how differences in the microbiome emerge between people, and whether this may explain why certain diseases are more common in specific populations. Self-identified race or ethnicity can be a useful tool in that effort, as it can serve as a proxy for cultural habits (such as diets) or genetic information. In the United States, self-identified East Asian Americans often have worse ‘metabolic health’ (e.g. levels of sugar or certain fat molecules in the blood) at a lower weight than those identifying as White. Ang, Alba, Upadhyay et al. investigated whether this health disparity was linked to variation in the gut microbiome. Samples were collected from 46 lean and obese individuals living in the San Francisco Bay Area who identified as White or East Asian. The analyses showed that while the gut microbiome of White participants changed in association with obesity, the microbiomes of East Asian participants were distinct from their White counterparts even at normal weight, with features mirroring what was seen in White individuals in the context of obesity. Although these differences were connected to people’s current address, they were not attributable to dietary differences. Ang, Alba, Upadhyay et al. then transplanted the microbiome of the participants into genetically identical mice with microbe-free guts. The differences between the gut microbiomes of White and East Asian participants persisted in recipient animals. When fed the same diet, the mice also gained different amounts of weight depending on the ethnic identity of the microbial donor.

There is increasing recognition that chronic diseases share common pathogenic features, some of which involve alterations in the composition, diversity, and functioning of the gut microbiota. This study examined whether socioeconomic-status was associated with alpha-diversity of the colonic microbiota. Forty-four healthy adults underwent un-prepped sigmoidoscopy, during which mucosal biopsies and fecal samples were collected. Subjects' zip codes were geocoded, and census data was used to form a composite indicator of neighborhood socioeconomic-status, reflecting household income, educational attainment, employment status, and home value. In unadjusted analyses, neighborhood socioeconomic-status explained 12-18 percent of the variability in alpha-diversity of colonic microbiota. The direction of these associations was positive, meaning that as neighborhood socioeconomic-status increased, so did alpha-diversity of both the colonic sigmoid mucosa and fecal microbiota. The strength of these associations persisted when models were expanded to include covariates reflecting potential demographic (age, gender, race/ethnicity) and lifestyle (adiposity, alcohol use, smoking) confounds. In these models neighborhood socioeconomic-status continued to explain 11-22 percent of the variability in diversity indicators. Further analyses suggested these patterns reflected socioeconomic variations in evenness, but not richness, of microbial communities residing in the sigmoid. We also found indications that residence in neighborhoods of higher socioeconomic-status was associated with a greater abundance of Bacteroides and a lower abundance of Prevotella, suggesting that diet potentially underlies differences in microbiota composition.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that a greater amount of F nucleatum in colorectal carcinoma tissue is associated with a lower density of T cells in tumor tissue. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on 598 rectal and colon carcinoma cases in 2 US nationwide prospective cohort studies with follow-up through 2006, the Nurses' Health Study (participants enrolled in 1976) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (participants enrolled in 1986). Tissue collection and processing were performed from 2002 through 2008, and immunity assessment, 2008 through 2009. From 2013 through 2014, the amount of F nucleatum in colorectal carcinoma tissue was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay; we equally dichotomized positive cases (high vs low). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted in 2014 to assess associations of the amount of F nucleatum with densities (quartiles) of T cells in tumor tissue, controlling for clinical and tumor molecular features, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) methylation, and KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutation status.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Densities of CD3+, CD8+, CD45RO (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C [PTPRC])+, and FOXP3+ T cells in tumor tissue, determined by means of tissue microarray immunohistochemical analysis and computer-assisted image analysis. RESULTS: F nucleatum was detected in colorectal carcinoma tissue in 76 (13%) of 598 cases.

First, the relative abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum spp. was significantly (P < 0.005) elevated continuously from intramucosal carcinoma to more advanced stages. Second, Atopobium parvulum and Actinomyces odontolyticus, which co-occurred in intramucosal carcinomas, were significantly (P < 0.005) increased only in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. Metabolome analyses showed that branched-chain amino acids and phenylalanine were significantly (P < 0.005) increased in intramucosal carcinomas and bile acids, including deoxycholate, were significantly (P < 0.005) elevated in multiple polypoid adenomas and/or intramucosal carcinomas. We identified metagenomic and metabolomic markers to discriminate cases of intramucosal carcinoma from the healthy controls. Our large-cohort multi-omics data indicate that shifts in the microbiome and metabolome occur from the very early stages of the development of colorectal cancer, which is of possible etiological and diagnostic importance.",Complete,

Here, we utilised the Guangdong Gut Microbiome Project (GGMP), the largest Eastern population-based gut microbiome dataset covering individuals with different economic statuses, to investigate the relationships between the gut microbiome and host physiology, diet, geography, physical activity and socioeconomic status. RESULTS: At the population level, 529 OTUs were significantly associated with MetS. OTUs from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes (other than Ruminococcaceae) were mainly positively associated with MetS, whereas those from Bacteroidetes and Ruminococcaceae were negatively associated with MetS. Two hundred fourteen OTUs were significantly associated with host economic status (140 positive and 74 negative associations), and 157 of these OTUs were also MetS associated. A microbial MetS index was formulated to represent the overall gut dysbiosis of MetS. The values of this index were significantly higher in MetS subjects regardless of their economic status or geographical location. The index values did not increase with increasing personal economic status, although the prevalence of MetS was significantly higher in people of higher economic status. With increased economic status, the study population tended to consume more fruits and vegetables and fewer grains, whereas meat consumption was unchanged. Sedentary time was significantly and positively associated with higher economic status. The MetS index showed an additive effect with sedentary lifestyle, as the prevalence of MetS in individuals with high MetS index values and unhealthy lifestyles was significantly higher than that in the rest of the population. CONCLUSIONS: The gut microbiome is associated with MetS and economic status. A prolonged sedentary lifestyle, rather than Westernised dietary patterns, was the most notable lifestyle change in our Eastern population along with economic development. Moreover, gut dysbiosis and a Western lifestyle had an additive effect on increasing MetS prevalence.",Complete,

It is unclear whether this benefit is preserved with donor milk (DM) feeding. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare microbiota development, growth, and feeding tolerance in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants fed an exclusively human milk diet of primarily MOM or DM. METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five VLBW infants born at Texas Children's Hospital were enrolled and grouped into cohorts based on percentage of MOM and DM in enteral feeds. Feeds were fortified with DM-derived fortifier per unit protocol. Weekly stool samples were collected for 6 wk for microbiota analysis [16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing]. A research nurse obtained weekly anthropometrics. Clinical outcomes were compared via Wilcoxon's rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test, as well as multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The DM cohort (n = 43) received on average 14% mothers' milk compared with 91% for the MOM cohort (n = 74). Diversity of gut microbiota across all time points (n = 546) combined was increased in MOM infants (P < 0.001).

We sought to learn more about early events of carcinogenesis by investigating shifts in the gut microbiota of patients with adenomas. METHODS: We analyzed 16S rRNA gene sequences from the fecal microbiota of patients with adenomas (n = 233) and without (n = 547). RESULTS: Multiple taxa were significantly more abundant in patients with adenomas, including Bilophila, Desulfovibrio, proinflammatory bacteria in the genus Mogibacterium, and multiple Bacteroidetes species. Patients without adenomas had greater abundances of Veillonella, Firmicutes (Order Clostridia), and Actinobacteria (family Bifidobacteriales). Our findings were consistent with previously reported shifts in the gut microbiota of colorectal cancer patients. Importantly, the altered adenoma profile is predicted to increase primary and secondary bile acid production, as well as starch, sucrose, lipid, and phenylpropanoid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: These data hint that increased sugar, protein, and lipid metabolism along with increased bile acid production could promote a colonic environment that supports the growth of bile-tolerant microbes such as Bilophilia and Desulfovibrio In turn, these microbes may produce genotoxic or inflammatory metabolites such as H2S and secondary bile acids, which could play a role in catalyzing adenoma development and eventually colorectal cancer. IMPACT: This study suggests a plausible biological mechanism to explain the links between shifts in the microbiota and colorectal cancer.

Multiple bacterial genera were differentially abundant between high and low SES children, including Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and Escherichia-Shigella. In addition, the microbiota of high SES children was less diverse and strongly associated with body mass index (BMI). In low SES children, helminth infection was prevalent and positively associated with Olsenella, Enterohabdus, Lactobacillus, and Mogibacterium abundance, while negatively associated with relative abundance of Prevotella. Protozoa infection was also prevalent, and positively associated with Rikenellaceae, while it was negatively associated with the relative abundance of Romboutsia and Prevotella. In conclusion, Indonesian schoolchildren living in urban Makassar share a core microbiota, but their microbiota varies in diversity and relative abundance of specific bacterial taxa depending on socioeconomic status, nutritional status, and intestinal parasites infection.",Complete,

Moreover, we investigated the mucosa-adherent microbial composition using rectal swab samples because the structure of the tissue-adherent bacterial community is potentially altered following bowel cleansing. Our findings indicated that the microbial structure of the intestinal lumen and cancerous tissue differed significantly. Phylotypes that enhance energy harvest from diets or perform metabolic exchange with the host were more abundant in the lumen. There were more abundant Firmicutes and less abundant Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in lumen. The overall microbial structures of cancerous tissue and noncancerous tissue were similar; however the tumor microbiota exhibited lower diversity. The structures of the intestinal lumen microbiota and mucosa-adherent microbiota were different in CRC patients compared to matched microbiota in healthy individuals. Lactobacillales was enriched in cancerous tissue, whereas Faecalibacterium was reduced. In the mucosa-adherent microbiota, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and Blautia were reduced in CRC patients, whereas Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus, and Mogibacterium were enriched. In the lumen, predominant phylotypes related to metabolic disorders or metabolic exchange with the host, Erysipelotrichaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Coriobacteriaceae were increased in cancer patients. Coupled with previous reports, these results suggest that the intestinal microbiota is associated with CRC risk and that intestinal lumen microflora potentially influence CRC risk via cometabolism or metabolic exchange with the host.

However, it is not known if colonic mucosa-associated taxa are indeed orally derived, if such cases are a distinct subset of patients or if the oral microbiome is generally suitable for screening for CRC. METHODS: We profiled the microbiota in oral swabs, colonic mucosae and stool from individuals with CRC (99 subjects), colorectal polyps (32) or controls (103). RESULTS: Several oral taxa were differentially abundant in CRC compared with controls, for example, Streptococcus and Prevotellas pp. A classification model of oral swab microbiota distinguished individuals with CRC or polyps from controls (sensitivity: 53% (CRC)/67% (polyps); specificity: 96%). Combining the data from faecal microbiota and oral swab microbiota increased the sensitivity of this model to 76% (CRC)/88% (polyps). We detected similar bacterial networks in colonic microbiota and oral microbiota datasets comprising putative oral biofilm forming bacteria. While these taxa were more abundant in CRC, core networks between pathogenic, CRC-associated oral bacteria such as Peptostreptococcus, Parvimonas and Fusobacterium were also detected in healthy controls. High abundance of Lachnospiraceae was negatively associated with the colonisation of colonic tissue with oral-like bacterial networks suggesting a protective role for certain microbiota types against CRC, possibly by conferring colonisation resistance to CRC-associated oral taxa and possibly mediated through habitual diet. CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity of CRC may relate to microbiota types that either predispose or provide resistance to the disease, and profiling the oral microbiome may offer an alternative screen for detecting CRC.",Complete,

Bangladeshi and U.S. children had distinct fecal bacterial community membership and structure; the microbiota of Bangladeshi children was enriched in Prevotella, Butyrivibrio, and Oscillospira and depleted in Bacteroides relative to U.S. children (although similar to Bangladeshi adults). Furthermore, community membership and structure in Bangladeshi children was significantly less stable month-to-month than U.S. children. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Together, these results suggest that differing environmental or genetic factors may shape the microbiota of healthy children in the two countries. Further investigation is necessary to understand the mechanisms and factors that underlie these differences, and to incorporate these findings into new strategies for the prevention and treatment of childhood and adolescent diseases.",Complete,

Few studies have been conducted in low-income settings where childhood malnutrition is common and possibly related to microbiota composition. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether gut microbiota composition in young children and their mothers is associated with different environmental exposures in rural Malawi. We hypothesized that more adverse environmental exposures would be associated with lower levels of microbiota maturity and diversity. METHODS: Faecal samples from up to 631 children and mothers participating in a nutrition intervention trial were collected at 1, 6, 12, 18, and 30 months (children) and at 1 month (mothers) after birth and analysed for microbiota composition with 16S rRNA sequencing. Bacterial OTU and genus abundances, measures of microbiota maturity and diversity, and UniFrac distances were compared between participants with different environmental exposures. The exposure variables included socio-economic status, water source, sanitary facility, domestic animals, maternal characteristics, season, antibiotic use, and delivery mode. RESULTS: Measures of microbiota maturity and diversity in children were inversely associated with maternal education at 6, 18, and 30 months and did not otherwise differ consistently between participants with different environmental exposures. Phylogenetic distance was related to season of stool sample collection at all time points. At the level of individual OTUs and genera, season of stool sample collection, type of water source, and maternal education showed most associations with child gut microbiota, while HIV status was the most important predictor of relative OTU and genus abundances in mothers. CONCLUSION: The results do not support the hypothesis that adverse environmental exposures are broadly associated with lower microbiota maturity and diversity but suggest that environmental exposures influence the abundance of several bacterial OTUs and genera and that low maternal education is associated with higher microbiota maturity and diversity.",Complete,

Most studies, however, focused on Americans or Europeans, giving a limited picture of the gut microbiome. To determine the generality of previous observations and expand our knowledge of the human gut microbiota, it is important to replicate studies in overlooked populations. Thus, we describe here, for the first time, the gut microbiota of Colombian adults via the pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), comparing it with results obtained in Americans, Europeans, Japanese and South Koreans, and testing the generality of previous observations concerning changes in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes with increasing body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: We found that the composition of the gut microbiota of Colombians was significantly different from that of Americans, Europeans and Asians. The geographic origin of the population explained more variance in the composition of this bacterial community than BMI or gender. Concerning changes in Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes with obesity, in Colombians we found a tendency in Firmicutes to diminish with increasing BMI, whereas no change was observed in Bacteroidetes. A similar result was found in Americans. A more detailed inspection of the Colombian dataset revealed that five fiber-degrading bacteria, including Akkermansia, Dialister, Oscillospira, Ruminococcaceae and Clostridiales, became less abundant in obese subjects.

However, gut dysbiosis associated with metabolic complications shows inconsistent patterns. This is likely driven by factors shaping gut microbial composition that have largely been under-evaluated, at a population level, in school-age children, especially from developing countries. RESULTS: Through characterization, by 16S sequencing, of the largest gut microbial population-based school-aged children cohort in Latin America (ORSMEC, N = 926, aged 6-12 y), we identified associations of 14 clinical and environmental covariates (PFDR<0.1), collectively explaining 15.7% of the inter-individual gut microbial variation. Extrinsic factors such as markers of socioeconomic status showed a major influence in the most abundant taxa and in the enterotypes' distribution. Age was positively correlated with higher diversity, but only in normal-weight children (rho = 0.138, P =2 × 10-3). In contrast, this correlation although not significant, was negative in overweight and obese children (rho = -0.125, P = 0.104 and rho = -0.058, P = 0.409, respectively).

However, considering pre-existing genetic and gut microbiota variation, the relevance remains unknown in the East-Asian NSCLC population. This study is designed to explore the relationship between gut microbiome and clinical outcomes in Chinese patients with NSCLC who have received treatment using an anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) blockade. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with advanced NSCLC receiving treatment with nivolumab were enrolled in CheckMate 078 (NCT02613507) and CheckMate 870 (NCT03195491). Fecal samples were collected at the starting point, when patients received nivolumab, at clinical evaluation, and when disease progression was noted. 16S ribosome RNA gene sequencing was applied to assess gut microbiota profiles. Peripheral immune signatures were determined by multicolor flow cytometry in parallel. RESULTS: When subgrouping patients into responder (R) and nonresponder according to the clinical response assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor version 1.1, R patients harbored higher diversity of gut microbiome at the starting point with stable composition during the treatment. Patients with high microbiome diversity had significantly prolonged progression-free survival when compared to those with low diversity. Compositional difference was observed between the two groups as well with the enrichment of Alistipes putredinis, Bifidobacterium longum, and Prevotella copri in R whereas Ruminococcus_unclassified enriched in nonresponding patients. Analysis of systemic immune responses using multicolor flow cytometry revealed that patients with a high abundance of microbiome diversity in the gut had a greater frequency of unique memory CD8+ T cell and natural killer cell subsets in the periphery in response to anti-PD-1 therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reveal strong correlation between gut microbiome diversity and the responses to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients with favorable gut microbiome (such as those with high diversity) exhibit enhanced memory T cell and natural killer cell signatures in the periphery. These findings provide important implications for the prediction and the evaluation of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy against NSCLC in the Chinese population.",Complete,Fatima

Our analysis of human and gut microbiome small RNA expression is relevant to generation of the first hypotheses about the potential molecular interactions occurring in the gut of CRC patients, and it can be the basis for further mechanistic studies and clinical tests.",Complete,

For 39 of the CRC patients, targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was carried out at formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples to identify somatic mutation profiles. Compared to the HC group, the microbial diversity of CRC patients was significantly lower. In the CRC group, we found a microbiome that was significantly enriched for strains of Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Megasphaera whereas in the HC group the abundance of Collinsella, Faecalibacterium, and Agathobacter strains was higher. Among the mutations detected in the CRC group, the APC gene had the highest mutation rate (77%, 30/39). We found that the KRAS mutant type was closely associated with Faecalibacterium, Roseburia, Megamonas, Lachnoclostridium, and Harryflintia. Notably, Spearman correlation analysis showed that KRAS mutations were negatively correlated with the existence of Bifidobacterium and positively correlated with Faecalibacterium. By employing 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we identified more unique features of microbiota profiles in CRC patients. For the first time, our study showed that gene mutations could directly be linked to the microbiota composition of CRC patients.

METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, no-treatment parallel control clinical trial involving 140 perioperative patients (90 men and 50 women, aged 40-75 y) with CRC was performed. Patients were randomly divided into two groups: an intervention group (prebiotic group, n = 70) that received prebiotic supplementation of 30 g/d for 7 d, and a control group (non-prebiotic group, n = 70) that received no prebiotic supplementation. The nutritional and immunologic indices were evaluated for both groups before and after operation and analyzed against baseline values. Moreover, fecal samples were collected from 40 patients randomly chosen from the two groups to study intestinal microbiota, which was analyzed by sequencing the V3-V4 region of 16S ribosomal DNA using the Illumina (San Diego, CA) MiSeq (PE 2 × 300 bp) platform. RESULTS: Oral intake of prebiotics produced significant effects on immunologic indices in both the preoperative and postoperative periods, but the patterns of effects were different. In the preoperative period, prebiotics increased serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG; P = 0.02), IgM (P = 0.00), and transferrin (P = 0.027; all P < 0.05). In the postoperative period, enhanced levels of IgG (P = 0.003), IgA (P = 0.007), suppressor/cytotoxic T cells (CD3+CD8+; P = 0.043), and total B lymphocytes (CD19+; P = 0.012) were identified in the prebiotic group (all P < 0.05). The differences in the intestinal microbiota at the phylum level were not statistically significant between the intervention and control groups (P > 0.05). At the genus level, prebiotics increased the abundance of Bifidobacterium (P = 0.017) and Enterococcus (P = 0.02; both P < 0.05) but decreased the abundance of Bacteroides (P = 0.04) in the preoperative period (all P < 0.05). In the postoperative period, the abundance of Bacteroides (P = 0.04) was decreased, but the abundance of Enterococcus (P = 0.00), Bacillus (P = 0.01), Lactococcus (P = 0.00), and Streptococcus (P = 0.037) increased in the non-prebiotic group (all P < 0.05); however, no significant change was identified in the abundance of Enterococcus (P = 0.56), Lactococcus (P = 0.07), and Streptococcus (P = 0.56) as a result of prebiotic intervention in this period (all P > 0.05). The abundance of Escherichia-Shigella was increased after prebiotic intake in the postoperative period (P = 0.014, P < 0.05). There was a notable trend of decline in the abundance of intestinal microbiota from preoperative to postoperative in the non-prebiotic group. CONCLUSIONS: Prebiotic intake is recommended to improve serum immunologic indicators in patients with CRC 7 d before operation. Prebiotics improved the abundance of four commensal microbiota containing opportunistic pathogens in patients with CRC. Surgical stress decreased the abundance of most intestinal microbiota in the intestinal tract but increased the abundance of some opportunistic pathogens and commensal microbiota.
